A six-degree-of-freedom platform (6-DOF Platform), also commonly known as a Stewart platform or 

parallel robot in academia, is a high-precision mechanical system capable of achieving full spatial free

dom of motion. By xxxx, with the rapid development of Industry 4.0 and underlying hardware technolo

gies for the metaverse, six-degree-of-freedom platforms have expanded from traditional aerospace 

equipment to civilian fields such as semiconductor manufacturing, intelligent cockpits, and high-end 

medical applications.


I. Technical Principles and Core Features

1. Kinematic Definition

"Six degrees of freedom" refers to the completeness of an object's motion in three-dimensional space


including:

• Three translational degrees of freedom: forward/backward, left/right, and up/down movement along 

the X, Y, and Z axes (position control).

• Three rotational degrees of freedom: pitch, roll, and yaw movements around the X, Y, and Z axes 

(attitude control).

2. Structural Features: Advantages of Parallel Mechanisms

Unlike common "serial" robotic arms (where joints are connected end-to-end), six-degree-of-freedom 

platforms typically employ a parallel structure – consisting of a base, a moving platform, and six retracta

ble electric actuators (or hydraulic cylinders) connecting the two. The significant advantages of this struc

ture include:

• High rigidity and high load capacity: The load is shared by the six legs, allowing it to carry several tons

 of weight while maintaining structural stability and resisting deformation.

• High dynamic accuracy: Due to the absence of error accumulation effects found in serial mechanisms, 

the platform performs exceptionally well in micron-level positioning and high-frequency vibration simu

lation.

• Fast response speed: Parallel drive enables the platform to simulate extremely high-frequency instanta

neous acceleration.


II. Description of Core Application Scenarios

With the iteration of sensors and algorithms, the application of six-degree-of-freedom platforms in 

xxxx has shown a trend of shifting from "heavy-duty simulation to precision control."

1. Aerospace and Military Training (Traditional Pillar)

This is the most classic application area for six-degree-of-freedom platforms. • Flight Simulator: By simu

lating various aircraft attitudes during takeoff, landing, turbulence, and overload conditions, it provides 

pilots with 1:1 realistic tactile feedback, significantly reducing training costs and risks.

• Satellite/Antenna Ground Calibration: Simulates weightlessness in space or satellite attitude adjustmen

t to test the pointing accuracy of on-board equipment.

2. Smart Cockpit and Autonomous Driving Testing (Hot in xxxx)

In xxxx, with the maturity of autonomous driving algorithms, the six-degree-of-freedom platform has 

become standard equipment for automotive R&D:

• Driving Environment Reproduction: The platform simulates the dynamic feedback of vehicles on comp

lex road surfaces (potholes, drifting, sudden braking), combined with VR/AR systems, allowing testers to

 experience realistic driving in the laboratory.

• Sensor Verification:  Lidar or cameras are mounted on the platform to simulate vibrations under extre

me road conditions, testing the robustness of perception algorithms.

3. Semiconductor and Optical Precision Manufacturing

In the field of micro- and nano-processing, the six-degree-of-freedom platform is mainly used as a prec

ision positioning stage:

• Wafer Alignment: Provides micron or even nanometer-level multi-dimensional attitude adjustment 

during photolithography or packaging processes.

• High-Power Laser Focusing: Ensures that optical components maintain extremely high focusing stabi

lity even during high-speed motion.

4. Medical Surgery and Biomechanics

• Minimally Invasive Surgical Robots: Some high-end surgical robots use miniature six-degree-of-freed

om parallel structures to achieve fine manipulation beyond the limits of human hands.

• Prosthetics and Gait Testing: Simulates the force state of human joints on various terrains, helping de

velopers optimize rehabilitation equipment.

5. Entertainment and Motion Simulators

• Professional-Grade Racing/Flight Simulators: In xxxx, lightweight six-degree-of-freedom platforms for 

high-end consumer players have entered homes, combined with metaverse headsets, providing a fully 

immersive interactive experience.

III. Technological Trends

1. Electrification of Drive Systems: Traditional hydraulic drives are rapidly being replaced by high-thrust 

electric servo actuators. Electric solutions are more environmentally friendly, easier to maintain, and 

offer higher control accuracy. 2. AI Motion Compensation Algorithm: Utilizing deep learning to predict 

motion delays and pre-compensate for platform inertia, the synchronization error between motion feed

back and visual signals is reduced to milliseconds, completely eliminating simulator-induced motion sickness.

3. Domestic Substitution: High-performance domestic servo systems, represented by brands such as 

Inovance Technology, are gradually replacing foreign core components in high-end six-degree-of-freed

om platforms, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.

IV. Conclusion

The six-degree-of-freedom platform, as fundamental hardware supporting modern high-tech industries,

 is not only a "sensory engine" for simulating the real world but also a crucial component in precision 

manufacturing. Whether conquering space, developing autonomous driving, or meticulously crafting 

microchips, the precise support of this core equipment is indispensable.

In fact,6-DOF parallel platform is also called Stewart parallel manipulator.It is used in various applications due to its high load-carrying capacity,accuracy and stiffness,such as aircraft,manufacturing industry and health care industry.However,the use of such parallel robots is not widespread due to these factors: the limited workspace,high cost,dexterity index and the singularity configurations existing inside the workspace.The parallel platform in this paper is mainly used for positioning of wings and ribs and assembly process of aircraft.The change of the workspace of the platform and dynamic performance has been affected the motion range and accuracy of workpieces to a great extent.Therefore,it is very important to optimize the structure of the parallel and improve the performance of the 6-DOF parallel platform.This paper mainly focuses on the optimization of the structural parameters of the6-DOF parallel platform.Firstly,the paper presented a mathematical model based on the platform.Then kinematics analysis is introduced and the inverse kinematics is also computed.In fact,the forward kinematics also played an important role in the structure optimization.So,the positive kinematics,Jacobian matrix is obtained in this paper.The relationship between singular configurations the Jacobian matrix and workspace of the parallel platform is also gained.Secondly,it presented a mathematical model of the dynamics based on the Stewart platform.And it established single body dynamics equation by New-Euler method.Furthermore,it established multi-body dynamics equations by Kane’s method by comparing four methods.Then it verified the correctness of the dynamics model using ADAMS software.Finally,the structure optimization of 6-DOF parallel manipulator is introduced.And it analyzed the impact of the geometrical parameters on the performance of the manipulator and determined the range of the parameters.Then the multi-objective and multi-constraint method is proposed and choose the appropriate variable boundaries.The linear combination of the workspace and leg force is used as the optimization function and the genetic algorithm automatically optimized the determined objective function,obtained specific optimizationresults.And it compared the optimized results with the previous results.

Tthe 6-DOF parallel motion platform had developed rapidly and were widely used in micromanufacturing,space docking,medical technology,optical fiber alignment,optical component alignment,tool inspection and other fields.Compared with the traditional series mechanism,the 6-DOF parallel motion platform has the advantages of more compact motion system,more rigidity,small cumulative error of motion,high load to weight ratio,and stable dynamic performance.However,due to its complex closed-loop mechanical structure,the parallel motion platform has poor mechanical properties such as flexibility and workspace.Therefore,this thesis takes the construction work of the 6-DOF precision motion positioning platform as the research basis,and conducts an in-depth research on the mechanism-related theories.The specific research content is mainly divided into the following aspects:Kinematics Analysis of 6-DOF Precision Motion Positioning Platform: Firstly,a complete kinematics model of the mechanism is established by the space coordinate vector analysis and coordinate transformation method.Then,3D modeling software and ADAMS dynamic simulation analysis software are used to simulate the inverse motion of the mechanism.The results obtained from the simulation analysis are compared with the results obtained from the calculation of inverse kinematic model of the mechanism in the computer,and the two results are close to each other,which verified the accuracy of the virtual prototype model.Finally,the accurate virtual prototype model is used in ADAMS to simulate the forward kinematics of the positioning platform,which solves the complicated problem of the traditional numerical method in the calculation of the forward kinematics of the mechanism.The dynamics analysis of the 6-DOF precision motion positioning platform: Firstly,the dynamics analysis of the branch drive mechanism of the mechanism is carried out by the Lagrangian method,and the influence of the rotary motion of the mechanism’s legs around its own axis and the case where the center of mass of the legs does not coincide with the axis are considered in the analysis and calculation,and the binding force on the hinge points of the branch drive mechanism is calculated.Then,using Newton-Euler method to study the object of the mechanism’s motion platform position,a complete dynamic model of the mechanism is given when considering that the platform motion control points do not coincide with the center of mass of the mechanism motion platform.Finally,the derived dynamics model is simulated in MATLAB to verify the feasibility of the dynamics model.Workspace analysis of the 6-DOF precision motion positioning platform: Firstly,according to the mechanical structure composition and work requirements of the precision motion positioning platform,the constraints of the working point sets in the mechanism workspace are determined.Then,the initial workspace positional point sets in the preset workspace are filtered by kinematic theory for the points in the initial workspace.Finally,the point sets that meet the constraints are plotted in MATLAB to obtain the mechanism workspace scatter diagram.Optimized design of structural parameters of 6-DOF precision motion positioning platform: Firstly,the factors affecting the mechanical performance of the precision motion positioning platform are given,and the variation range of structural parameters is determined.Then,according to the actual working requirements of the precision motion positioning platform,the mechanism optimization objective function is established with the mechanical performance indexes of mechanism motion space maximization and dexterity,and the mechanical structure parameters of the mechanism are optimized and designed.Finally,the mechanical performance indexes of the mechanism before and after optimization are compared,and it can be seen that the optimized mechanism obtains better mechanical performance.In this paper,the related mechanism theory and mechanism parameter optimization problem of the parallel mechanism are deeply studied,which provides the related theoretical basis for the development of the parallel mechanism prototype.
