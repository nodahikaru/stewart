1. Introduction

1.1 Background and Motivation

* Large-aperture satellite antennas (≥12 m)
Large-aperture satellite antennas with diameters exceeding 12 m play a critical role in modern space missions, including deep-space communication, Earth observation, radio astronomy, and high-throughput satellite systems. The continuous demand for higher data rates, improved signal-to-noise ratios, and enhanced spatial resolution has driven the development of antennas with increasingly larger apertures. A larger reflector diameter directly improves antenna gain and directivity, making such systems indispensable for long-distance and high-precision space communication tasks.

However, the growth in antenna aperture introduces substantial engineering challenges. Large-aperture antennas are characterized by high structural mass, large moments of inertia, and significant sensitivity to pointing errors. Even minor angular deviations can result in considerable signal degradation, particularly in high-frequency applications such as Ka-band and Q/V-band communications. Consequently, antenna pointing mechanisms must achieve high positioning accuracy, strong load-bearing capability, and excellent structural stiffness, while maintaining reliability over long operational lifetimes in harsh environments.

From a mechanical perspective, the actuation and support of large satellite antennas represent a multi-disciplinary problem involving structural mechanics, kinematics, dynamics, and control. Traditional antenna drive systems—often based on serial mechanisms or limited-degree-of-freedom rotary actuators—face inherent limitations when applied to large and heavy antennas. These limitations include insufficient stiffness, uneven load distribution, increased structural deformation, and reduced dynamic performance under external disturbances such as wind loads (for ground-based systems) or inertial effects during maneuvering.

Moreover, the increasing complexity of modern satellite missions requires antennas to perform multi-axis motions, including precise azimuth, elevation, and attitude adjustments. This requirement further exacerbates the shortcomings of conventional drive architectures, which typically rely on cascaded actuators and bearings, leading to error accumulation, reduced rigidity, and higher maintenance demands.

In this context, advanced actuation solutions capable of simultaneously providing high load capacity, compact structural design, and multi-degree-of-freedom motion are urgently needed. Parallel robotic mechanisms, particularly six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel robots, have emerged as promising candidates for addressing these challenges due to their intrinsic advantages in stiffness, accuracy, and force distribution. Their potential application as driving and positioning systems for large-aperture satellite antennas motivates the research presented in this paper.
* Challenges: mass, inertia, precision pointing, structural stiffness
The driving and positioning of large-aperture satellite antennas present significant technical challenges due to their high mass, large geometric scale, and stringent precision requirements. As the antenna diameter increases to 12 m or beyond, the overall system exhibits a substantial increase in mass and rotational inertia, which directly impacts the performance of the drive mechanism. These characteristics demand actuation systems capable of generating large driving forces and torques while maintaining smooth and precise motion across multiple degrees of freedom.

One of the primary challenges lies in the structural deformation induced by gravity, inertial loads, and external disturbances. For large antennas, even small elastic deformations of the supporting structure or drive mechanism can lead to non-negligible pointing errors. This issue becomes particularly critical for high-frequency communication systems, where angular accuracy on the order of arc-seconds may be required. Consequently, the drive system must exhibit high stiffness and uniform load distribution to minimize deflection under both static and dynamic conditions.

Another major difficulty is the coupling between motion axes in conventional antenna drive systems. Traditional architectures typically employ serial arrangements of rotary joints to realize azimuth and elevation motions. While such systems are mechanically simple, they suffer from cumulative positioning errors, uneven load sharing among components, and reduced dynamic responsiveness when scaled to large antenna sizes. Additionally, the bearings and gear transmissions used in these systems are subject to high localized stresses, leading to increased wear and reduced long-term reliability.

The dynamic behavior of large and massive antennas further complicates their actuation. During rapid pointing maneuvers or tracking operations, the drive system must overcome large inertial forces without inducing excessive vibration or oscillation. Poor dynamic performance can result in prolonged settling times, degraded tracking accuracy, and increased control effort. These issues are exacerbated by the flexible nature of large antenna structures, which may exhibit low-frequency vibration modes that interact with the drive system dynamics.

Furthermore, the multi-axis motion requirements of modern antenna systems impose additional constraints on drive mechanism design. Advanced satellite missions often require not only azimuth and elevation adjustments but also fine attitude corrections to compensate for structural deformation, thermal effects, or installation misalignments. Achieving such motion capabilities with traditional drive systems typically necessitates additional actuators and complex mechanical assemblies, increasing system mass, footprint, and maintenance complexity.

Taken together, these challenges highlight the limitations of conventional antenna driving approaches when applied to large and massive antennas. There is a clear need for actuation solutions that can provide high load-carrying capacity, enhanced stiffness, precise multi-degree-of-freedom motion, and robust dynamic performance within a compact and structurally efficient framework. Addressing these challenges forms the core motivation for investigating advanced driving mechanisms and optimization methodologies for large-aperture antenna systems.
* Limitations of conventional serial and single-DOF drive systems
Limitations of Conventional Drive Systems

Conventional drive systems for large-aperture satellite antennas are predominantly based on serial kinematic architectures, typically employing azimuth–elevation (Az–El) or polar mount configurations driven by rotary actuators, gear trains, and large-diameter bearings. While these systems have been widely used in small- to medium-sized antennas, their performance degrades significantly as antenna size and mass increase.

A fundamental limitation of serial drive systems is their inherent accumulation of errors. In serial architectures, positioning inaccuracies, backlash, and compliance in each joint propagate along the kinematic chain, resulting in amplified end-point errors at the antenna reflector. For large antennas, this effect is further exacerbated by long structural lever arms, making it increasingly difficult to achieve the high pointing accuracy required for modern high-frequency and deep-space applications.

Another critical drawback lies in the uneven distribution of loads within conventional drive mechanisms. Az–El systems concentrate gravitational and inertial loads on a limited number of bearings and gear interfaces, leading to high localized stresses. As antenna mass increases, these components must be oversized to maintain structural integrity, which in turn increases system weight, manufacturing cost, and installation complexity. Despite such reinforcement, structural deformation and bearing misalignment remain difficult to eliminate, especially under variable loading conditions.

The limited stiffness and dynamic performance of traditional drive systems further constrain their applicability to large and massive antennas. The presence of long transmission chains, gear reducers, and flexible support structures reduces overall system rigidity and introduces compliance that negatively affects dynamic response. During fast pointing or tracking maneuvers, these systems may exhibit vibration, oscillation, or long settling times, which degrade operational efficiency and control performance.

Moreover, conventional antenna drives typically provide restricted motion flexibility, being primarily designed for two rotational degrees of freedom. Any additional motion capabilities—such as fine attitude correction, compensation for structural deformation, or installation misalignment—require supplementary mechanisms or control strategies. This results in increased mechanical complexity, higher failure risk, and reduced maintainability, particularly for large-scale antenna installations.

Scalability is another major concern. As antenna diameter and mass continue to increase, the physical size and footprint of traditional drive systems grow disproportionately. Large foundations, massive support structures, and heavy-duty bearings become necessary, limiting deployment flexibility and increasing infrastructure requirements. These factors pose significant challenges for both ground-based and mobile antenna platforms.

In summary, while conventional serial drive systems have proven effective for smaller antennas, their structural, kinematic, and dynamic limitations make them increasingly unsuitable for driving and positioning large-aperture, high-mass antennas. These shortcomings motivate the exploration of alternative actuation architectures capable of offering improved stiffness, load distribution, precision, and motion versatility within a more compact and scalable framework.

Advantages of Parallel Robots for Large Antenna Actuation

Parallel robotic mechanisms, particularly six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel robots, offer a fundamentally different actuation paradigm compared to conventional serial drive systems. Their structural and kinematic characteristics make them especially well suited for the driving and positioning of large-aperture, high-mass satellite antennas.

One of the most significant advantages of parallel robots is their high structural stiffness. In a parallel architecture, multiple kinematic chains simultaneously support and actuate the moving platform, enabling load sharing among actuators and structural members. This configuration substantially reduces elastic deformation under gravitational and inertial loads, which is a critical requirement for maintaining pointing accuracy in large antennas. The closed-loop structure of parallel robots inherently enhances rigidity and minimizes compliance compared to serial mechanisms.

Parallel robots also exhibit superior load-carrying capability and force distribution. Instead of concentrating loads on a small number of joints or bearings, the antenna mass and dynamic forces are distributed across multiple actuators and links. This uniform load distribution reduces peak stresses, improves fatigue life, and enhances overall mechanical reliability. For large antennas with significant mass and moments of inertia, this characteristic is particularly advantageous.

Another key benefit lies in the decoupling of motion accuracy from actuator placement. In parallel robots, actuators are typically mounted on or near the fixed base, resulting in reduced moving mass and improved dynamic response. This design minimizes inertia-related effects during motion, allowing faster and more stable pointing maneuvers. Additionally, the reduced moving mass contributes to lower energy consumption and improved control performance.

Parallel robots naturally provide multi-degree-of-freedom motion within a compact structural envelope. A 6-DOF parallel robot can simultaneously realize translational and rotational motions, enabling precise antenna positioning and orientation correction. This capability is particularly valuable for compensating structural deformation, thermal distortion, and installation misalignment—tasks that are difficult or inefficient to achieve with conventional antenna drive systems.

From a scalability perspective, parallel robots offer a favorable path toward large-scale antenna actuation. By appropriately optimizing geometric and structural parameters, parallel mechanisms can be tailored to accommodate increased payload mass and workspace requirements without a proportional increase in system size or complexity. This scalability makes them attractive candidates for next-generation large-aperture antenna systems.

Despite these advantages, the performance of parallel robots is highly dependent on their structural configuration and geometric parameters. Poorly designed architectures may suffer from limited workspace, singular configurations, or excessive actuator forces. Therefore, systematic modeling and optimization of structural parameters are essential to fully exploit the benefits of parallel robots in large antenna applications. This observation forms the central motivation for the research presented in this paper.

Need for Structural Parameter Optimization

While parallel robots offer significant advantages for driving and positioning large-aperture satellite antennas, their performance is highly sensitive to the selection of structural and geometric parameters. Parameters such as link lengths, platform radii, joint arrangement, and actuator placement directly influence key performance characteristics, including workspace, stiffness, load distribution, and dynamic behavior. For applications involving large and massive antennas, inappropriate parameter selection can severely limit system effectiveness and even compromise operational safety.

One of the primary challenges arises from the trade-off between workspace and stiffness. Increasing the size of the parallel robot may enlarge the reachable workspace and accommodate large antenna motions; however, it often leads to reduced structural rigidity and higher actuator forces. Conversely, designs optimized solely for stiffness may result in restricted workspace or unfavorable kinematic configurations. Balancing these competing objectives is particularly critical when the antenna diameter and inertia are substantial, as in the case of 12 m-class antennas.

Structural parameters also have a profound impact on the force transmission characteristics of parallel robots. The geometric arrangement of the limbs determines the Jacobian matrix, which governs the relationship between actuator forces and external loads acting on the antenna. Poorly conditioned Jacobians can lead to excessive actuator forces, uneven load sharing, or proximity to singular configurations. For large antennas subjected to significant gravitational and inertial loads, such conditions are unacceptable and must be systematically avoided through careful structural design.

In addition, the dynamic performance of the antenna–robot system is strongly influenced by geometric parameters. Link lengths and platform dimensions affect the system’s natural frequencies, vibration modes, and inertial coupling. Large antennas typically exhibit low-frequency flexible modes that may interact with the robot dynamics, leading to degraded pointing accuracy and control instability if not properly accounted for. Structural optimization provides a means to enhance dynamic robustness while maintaining acceptable motion performance.

From a practical engineering standpoint, optimization of structural parameters enables the realization of compact, scalable, and efficient designs. Instead of relying on oversized actuators or excessively rigid structures to meet performance requirements, a well-optimized parallel robot can achieve superior performance through intelligent geometric configuration. This approach is particularly valuable for large antenna systems, where constraints on footprint, mass, and cost are often stringent.

Therefore, systematic optimization of the structural parameters of a 6-DOF parallel robot is not merely an enhancement but a necessity for its effective application in large-aperture antenna driving systems. By integrating kinematic, static, and dynamic performance indices into the design process, an optimized parallel robot can fully exploit its inherent advantages and meet the demanding requirements of large and massive antenna actuation. This necessity forms the central motivation and foundation of the present study.

1.2 Parallel Robots for Large Antenna Actuation
1.2.1 Advantages of 6-DOF Parallel Mechanisms

Six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel mechanisms have attracted considerable attention in applications requiring high load capacity, superior rigidity, and precise motion control. Unlike serial manipulators, parallel robots consist of multiple kinematic chains that simultaneously connect the fixed base to the moving platform, forming a closed-loop structure. This architectural characteristic provides inherent mechanical advantages that are particularly relevant for large-aperture antenna actuation.

First, 6-DOF parallel mechanisms exhibit excellent load-carrying capability due to their ability to distribute external loads among multiple limbs and actuators. For large and massive antennas, the gravitational forces and inertial loads can be substantial. Parallel architectures reduce peak stresses in individual components by sharing these loads, thereby enhancing structural reliability and fatigue resistance.

Second, the high structural rigidity of parallel robots makes them well suited for precision-driven applications. The closed-loop configuration significantly limits elastic deformation under external loads, which is essential for maintaining antenna pointing accuracy. Compared with serial mechanisms, parallel robots generally exhibit higher stiffness-to-mass ratios, allowing them to sustain large payloads while preserving structural compactness.

Third, 6-DOF parallel mechanisms provide high positioning and orientation accuracy. Because actuators are typically located on or near the fixed base, the moving mass is minimized, reducing inertial effects and improving dynamic response. Furthermore, the absence of long serial chains limits error accumulation, enabling accurate control of the antenna’s spatial position and attitude.

Finally, the inherent multi-degree-of-freedom motion capability of 6-DOF parallel robots enables simultaneous translational and rotational adjustments. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for large antenna systems, where fine attitude correction may be required to compensate for structural deformation, thermal expansion, or installation misalignment.

1.2.2 Relevance of Stewart / Gough–Stewart–Type Platforms

Among various parallel robot architectures, the Stewart platform—also known as the Gough–Stewart platform—stands out as one of the most widely studied and practically implemented 6-DOF parallel mechanisms. It consists of six independently actuated limbs connecting a fixed base to a moving platform through spherical or universal joints, providing full spatial motion capability.

The Stewart-type platform is especially relevant for large antenna actuation due to its structural symmetry and compact design. The symmetric arrangement of the limbs facilitates uniform load distribution and balanced force transmission, which are crucial for handling large payloads with high moments of inertia. Additionally, the geometric simplicity of the Stewart platform allows systematic parameterization of its structural dimensions, making it suitable for optimization-based design approaches.

Another important advantage of Stewart-type platforms is their high stiffness and controllability across a wide range of configurations. By appropriately selecting the platform radii, limb lengths, and joint layout, the workspace and performance characteristics can be tailored to specific antenna motion requirements. This adaptability is particularly valuable when designing actuation systems for large-aperture antennas with strict performance constraints.

Moreover, the Stewart platform has a well-established theoretical foundation in kinematics, statics, and dynamics, supported by extensive prior research and practical applications in flight simulators, precision positioning systems, and aerospace testing equipment. This maturity provides a reliable basis for extending the platform’s application to large antenna actuation while enabling rigorous analytical and optimization-based investigations.

For these reasons, the Stewart/Gough–Stewart–type 6-DOF parallel robot is selected in this study as the fundamental actuation architecture for driving and positioning a large-aperture satellite antenna. The focus of the present work is therefore placed on the systematic modeling and structural parameter optimization of this class of parallel robots to meet the demanding requirements of large antenna applications.

1.3 Research Gap and Problem Statement

Although parallel robotic mechanisms, particularly Stewart-type platforms, have been extensively investigated in the context of precision positioning and motion simulation, their structural optimization for driving large-mass satellite antennas remains insufficiently addressed. The majority of existing optimization studies consider parallel robots operating under relatively light payloads or assume simplified loading conditions, where the influence of large mass and distributed inertia is either neglected or significantly underestimated. As a result, these studies cannot be directly extended to antenna systems with diameters on the order of 12 m, which exhibit substantial gravitational loading, large moments of inertia, and strong force–moment coupling.

For large-aperture antennas, the payload mass and inertia fundamentally alter the static and dynamic characteristics of the driving mechanism. Gravitational forces generate significant actuator loads even in quasi-static conditions, while inertial effects during pointing and tracking motions impose additional force and torque demands. However, many existing design methodologies emphasize kinematic feasibility—such as workspace size, dexterity, or manipulability—without explicitly incorporating antenna mass properties and load-induced effects into the optimization framework. Consequently, designs obtained through such approaches may be kinematically valid but mechanically impractical or unsafe when scaled to large-mass antenna applications.

A further limitation of current research lies in the lack of integrated structural–workspace–force optimization frameworks tailored to antenna actuation. Structural parameters, including platform radii, limb lengths, and joint layout, simultaneously influence the reachable workspace, stiffness characteristics, and actuator force transmission. Optimizing these aspects independently often leads to conflicting design outcomes, such as excessive actuator forces, reduced stiffness, or operation near singular configurations. This issue is particularly critical for large antenna systems, where structural deformation, uneven load distribution, or actuator overload cannot be tolerated.

Moreover, existing force and stiffness analyses are frequently conducted under simplified assumptions, such as uniform external loading or decoupled translational and rotational effects. In contrast, large-mass antennas generate highly coupled force and moment loads due to their size and inertia distribution, which can significantly degrade performance if not properly accounted for during the design stage. The absence of application-driven optimization formulations that explicitly consider these coupled effects represents a major gap in the current literature.

In contrast to existing studies, the present work explicitly incorporates the distributed mass and inertia characteristics of a 12 m-class antenna into the structural optimization of a 6-DOF parallel robot. The core problem addressed in this paper is therefore defined as follows:
to systematically determine the optimized structural parameters of a 6-DOF parallel robot that achieve a balanced improvement in workspace capability, force transmission performance, and structural robustness while reliably driving a large-mass satellite antenna under realistic loading conditions.

2. Related Work and Literature Review

2.1 6-DOF Parallel Robots and Stewart Platforms

* Classical configurations and variants
Six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel robots represent one of the most extensively studied classes of spatial mechanisms due to their capability to generate full translational and rotational motion with high stiffness and accuracy. Among them, the Stewart platform—also known as the Gough–Stewart platform—has become a canonical architecture and serves as the foundation for many subsequent developments in parallel robot design.

The classical Stewart platform consists of six independently actuated extensible limbs connecting a fixed base to a moving platform through spherical or universal joints. Each limb forms a kinematic chain, and the six chains operate in parallel to control the spatial pose of the moving platform. This closed-loop configuration provides inherent advantages in load distribution and rigidity, which have motivated its adoption in applications such as flight simulators, precision positioning systems, and aerospace testing platforms.

Over time, numerous structural variants of the Stewart platform have been proposed to improve specific performance characteristics. These variants differ primarily in joint types, limb arrangements, and actuation schemes. Common configurations include 6-UPS, 6-RUS, 6-SPS, and 6-PRS architectures, where the letters denote the sequence of joint types from base to platform (Universal, Revolute, Spherical, and Prismatic). Each configuration exhibits distinct kinematic properties, workspace shapes, and force transmission characteristics, making them suitable for different application scenarios.

In addition to joint-type variations, geometric arrangement of the limbs has been a major research focus. Symmetric layouts, such as hexagonal or circular distributions of attachment points, are often favored for their balanced force transmission and uniform stiffness characteristics. Asymmetric or reconfigurable layouts have also been explored to expand workspace or avoid singularities, although these designs often introduce increased modeling and control complexity.

Another important class of variants involves actuation placement and limb structure. In many designs, actuators are mounted on the fixed base to reduce moving mass and improve dynamic performance. Hybrid limbs combining rigid links and linear actuators have also been proposed to enhance stiffness while maintaining motion range. These design choices significantly affect the dynamic behavior and scalability of the mechanism, particularly for high-payload applications.

Despite the extensive diversity of Stewart platform variants, the majority of existing studies focus on general-purpose performance improvement, such as workspace enlargement, dexterity enhancement, or singularity avoidance, without explicitly considering application-specific requirements. For large-scale systems, such as antenna actuation, the suitability of different configurations must be evaluated in the context of payload mass, inertia, and force transmission demands—factors that are not always adequately addressed in classical studies.

In summary, classical 6-DOF parallel robot configurations and their variants provide a rich design foundation with well-established theoretical models. However, their applicability to large-mass antenna driving systems depends critically on structural configuration choices and parameter optimization, which motivates further investigation beyond traditional architectural comparisons.

* Applications in simulators, aerospace, and precision systems
Since their introduction, 6-DOF parallel robots—most notably Stewart and Gough–Stewart platforms—have been widely adopted in applications requiring high precision, high stiffness, and reliable multi-axis motion. Their closed-loop kinematic structure and favorable load distribution characteristics have made them particularly suitable for demanding engineering systems.

One of the earliest and most influential application domains of Stewart platforms is motion simulation, especially in flight and vehicle simulators. In these systems, parallel platforms are used to reproduce translational and rotational motions with high fidelity while supporting heavy payloads, such as full-scale cockpit modules. Research in this area has focused on workspace optimization, motion cueing performance, and dynamic response, establishing Stewart platforms as a mature and reliable solution for high-load, high-precision motion generation.

In aerospace engineering, 6-DOF parallel robots have been extensively employed in structural testing, vibration isolation, and alignment systems. Their high stiffness and ability to precisely control both position and orientation make them well suited for simulating aerodynamic loads, testing spacecraft components, and aligning sensitive instruments. Parallel platforms have also been investigated for satellite component handling, docking simulation, and ground-based testing of space mechanisms, where accurate reproduction of multi-axis loads and motions is essential.

Another important application domain is precision positioning and metrology, including optical alignment systems, micro-positioning stages, and antenna pointing devices. In these applications, Stewart platforms are valued for their sub-millimeter or even micron-level positioning accuracy, as well as their ability to compensate for small misalignments and structural deformations. Their capability to provide fine attitude adjustments has led to their use in telescope mounts, optical benches, and high-precision measurement equipment.

Despite their success in these domains, the majority of existing applications involve moderate payloads or relatively compact platforms, where mass and inertia effects are manageable. Even in aerospace testing and simulation, the emphasis is often placed on motion accuracy and control rather than on structural optimization under extremely large and distributed loads. Consequently, while Stewart platforms have demonstrated strong potential for high-load applications, their direct extension to large-mass, large-aperture antenna actuation remains insufficiently explored.

In particular, antenna driving systems impose a unique combination of requirements, including long-term static load holding, limited but highly precise angular motion, and strong resistance to deformation under gravitational and inertial effects. These requirements differ fundamentally from those of simulators or laboratory-scale precision systems. Therefore, although existing applications confirm the robustness and versatility of 6-DOF parallel robots, they also highlight the need for application-specific modeling and optimization when such mechanisms are employed for large antenna actuation.

2.2 Structural Parameter Optimization of Parallel Mechanisms

* Geometric parameter studies
Geometric parameter optimization has long been recognized as a fundamental aspect of parallel mechanism design, as geometric configuration directly determines kinematic performance, load transmission, and structural behavior. In the context of 6-DOF parallel robots, geometric parameters typically include limb lengths, base and moving platform radii, joint attachment locations, and limb orientation angles. Extensive research has been devoted to investigating how these parameters influence the overall performance of parallel mechanisms.

Early studies on geometric parameter optimization primarily focused on workspace-related criteria. Researchers analyzed the effects of platform dimensions and limb lengths on reachable and dexterous workspace, often aiming to maximize workspace volume or avoid kinematic singularities. These studies provided valuable insights into feasible geometric layouts and established basic design guidelines for Stewart-type platforms. However, such approaches largely emphasized kinematic reachability without considering load-bearing or force-related performance.

Subsequent research expanded geometric parameter studies to include kinematic performance indices, such as manipulability, condition number of the Jacobian matrix, and isotropy measures. By optimizing these indices, designers sought to achieve uniform motion transmission and improved numerical conditioning across the workspace. While these metrics are useful for evaluating motion quality, they are inherently kinematics-driven and do not fully capture the mechanical feasibility of parallel robots operating under heavy payloads.

More recent works have incorporated static and stiffness-related considerations into geometric optimization. In these studies, geometric parameters are adjusted to enhance structural stiffness or reduce deformation under external loads. Analytical and numerical stiffness models have been used to evaluate the influence of platform geometry on translational and rotational compliance. These contributions represent an important step toward more realistic design methodologies; however, the external loads considered are often simplified or normalized, limiting their relevance to large-mass applications.

Despite these advances, existing geometric parameter studies typically treat workspace, stiffness, and force transmission as loosely coupled or sequential design objectives. In many cases, geometric parameters are first selected to satisfy workspace requirements and subsequently refined to improve stiffness or force characteristics. Such decoupled approaches may lead to suboptimal designs when applied to systems with strong load–geometry coupling, such as large-aperture antenna actuation.

Furthermore, most geometric optimization studies assume generic payload conditions, neglecting the distributed mass and inertia effects associated with large and heavy end-effectors. For large antennas, geometric parameters critically affect not only kinematic performance but also actuator force magnitudes, load distribution among limbs, and proximity to singular configurations under gravitational loading. These effects are not adequately captured by traditional geometric optimization frameworks.

In summary, while geometric parameter studies have established a solid theoretical foundation for parallel mechanism design, their applicability to large-mass antenna driving systems remains limited. There is a clear need for application-driven geometric optimization approaches that explicitly account for payload mass properties and the coupled influence of geometry on workspace, force transmission, and structural robustness.

* Force transmission and stiffness optimization
Force transmission and stiffness characteristics are critical performance factors in parallel mechanisms, particularly for applications involving heavy payloads and high precision requirements. In 6-DOF parallel robots, these characteristics are strongly influenced by structural geometry and joint configuration, making them central objectives in structural parameter optimization studies.

A large body of research has focused on force transmission analysis using Jacobian-based formulations. The relationship between actuator forces and external loads acting on the moving platform is governed by the transpose of the Jacobian matrix. Performance indices such as actuator force amplification factors, force manipulability ellipsoids, and condition numbers have been widely employed to evaluate the quality of force transmission. Optimization efforts based on these indices aim to reduce peak actuator forces, improve load-sharing among limbs, and avoid configurations with poor force transmission characteristics.

In parallel, stiffness optimization has been extensively investigated due to its direct impact on positioning accuracy and vibration resistance. Stiffness modeling approaches for parallel robots typically include analytical methods based on compliance matrices, virtual joint modeling, and finite-element-based techniques. These models are used to assess translational and rotational stiffness of the moving platform as functions of structural parameters. Optimization strategies seek to enhance global or local stiffness by adjusting platform dimensions, limb orientations, and joint placements.

Several studies have demonstrated that optimizing stiffness-related indices can significantly improve the static accuracy of parallel mechanisms. However, stiffness enhancement is often achieved at the expense of reduced workspace or increased actuator force demands. This trade-off highlights the intrinsic coupling between stiffness, force transmission, and kinematic capability, which complicates structural optimization.

Despite the progress in force transmission and stiffness optimization, most existing studies consider simplified loading scenarios, such as unit forces or decoupled translational loads, and neglect the combined effects of forces and moments acting on the moving platform. For large and massive end-effectors, such as satellite antennas, gravitational and inertial loads generate coupled force–moment vectors that significantly affect actuator force distribution and stiffness requirements. Optimization frameworks that do not explicitly account for these coupled effects may yield designs that are theoretically optimal but practically infeasible.

Furthermore, many optimization studies treat force transmission and stiffness as independent or secondary objectives, often optimized after geometric feasibility has been established. This sequential treatment fails to capture the strong interdependence between structural geometry and mechanical performance, particularly under heavy payload conditions. As a result, the optimized designs may operate close to singular configurations or exhibit uneven force distribution among actuators when subjected to realistic loads.

In conclusion, while force transmission and stiffness optimization have significantly advanced the design of parallel mechanisms, existing approaches remain insufficient for large-mass antenna actuation. There is a clear need for integrated structural optimization methodologies that simultaneously consider geometric configuration, force transmission efficiency, and stiffness performance under realistic, antenna-driven loading conditions.

* Workspace-driven design approaches
Workspace capability is a fundamental design criterion for parallel mechanisms, as it directly determines the range of attainable positions and orientations of the moving platform. In 6-DOF parallel robots, workspace characteristics are strongly dependent on structural parameters such as limb lengths, platform dimensions, and joint layout. As a result, workspace-driven design has been widely adopted as a primary approach in the structural optimization of parallel mechanisms.

Early workspace-oriented studies focused on identifying feasible geometric configurations that maximize the reachable workspace while avoiding kinematic singularities. Analytical and numerical methods were developed to compute the boundary of translational and rotational workspace, often assuming ideal joint ranges and neglecting load-induced constraints. These studies provided valuable guidelines for selecting basic geometric proportions and established a theoretical foundation for parallel robot design.

Subsequent research introduced the concept of dexterous workspace, defined as the subset of the reachable workspace in which performance indices such as manipulability or Jacobian conditioning remain within acceptable limits. By constraining optimization to the dexterous workspace, designers aimed to ensure uniform motion transmission and stable control performance. Structural parameters were adjusted to enlarge this high-quality workspace region, leading to improved kinematic robustness.

In addition, several studies explored orientation-dominant or task-specific workspace optimization, where the geometric configuration is tailored to a prescribed motion range. Such approaches are particularly relevant for applications with limited but precise motion requirements, including pointing and alignment systems. By constraining the workspace to task-relevant regions, these methods can reduce unnecessary structural complexity and improve local performance.

Despite their effectiveness, workspace-driven design approaches often treat workspace capability as an isolated objective, largely decoupled from mechanical performance considerations. In many cases, structural optimization is performed without explicitly considering actuator force limits, stiffness degradation, or load-dependent constraints. For systems operating under light payloads, this simplification may be acceptable; however, for large-mass applications, it can lead to designs that are kinematically feasible but mechanically impractical.

For large-aperture antenna actuation, workspace requirements are typically characterized by limited angular motions with stringent precision and load-holding demands, rather than large translational ranges. Optimizing geometric parameters solely to maximize workspace volume may therefore be inefficient or even detrimental, as it can reduce stiffness and increase actuator force requirements under gravitational loading. Moreover, workspace boundaries in large antenna systems are often constrained by force transmission and structural robustness rather than purely kinematic limits.

In summary, while workspace-driven design approaches have significantly contributed to the understanding and optimization of parallel mechanism geometry, their applicability to large-mass antenna driving systems is limited when used in isolation. This limitation highlights the necessity of integrating workspace considerations with force transmission and stiffness constraints in a unified structural optimization framework tailored to antenna-specific operational requirements.

2.3 Large Satellite and Deployable Antenna Drive Mechanisms

* Structural and actuation challenges of large antennas
Large satellite and deployable antenna systems present a distinct set of structural and actuation challenges due to their large geometric scale, high mass, and stringent pointing accuracy requirements. As antenna apertures increase to meet the demands of high-frequency communication and deep-space missions, the complexity of their mechanical support and driving mechanisms grows significantly.

One of the most prominent challenges is the structural flexibility inherent in large-aperture antennas. Lightweight materials and deployable structures are often employed to reduce launch mass, resulting in low structural stiffness and pronounced elastic deformation. Under gravitational loading in ground-based systems, or under inertial and thermal loads in space environments, these flexible structures can experience significant deflections that directly affect antenna pointing accuracy.

The mass and inertia characteristics of large antennas further complicate actuation system design. A 12 m-class antenna exhibits large rotational inertia, requiring substantial driving torque to achieve even modest angular accelerations. During tracking or repositioning maneuvers, the actuation system must overcome these inertial effects while avoiding excessive vibration and maintaining smooth motion. Traditional drive systems often struggle to balance these competing demands, particularly when scaled to large antenna sizes.

Another critical issue is the load transmission and distribution within antenna drive mechanisms. In conventional designs, gravitational and inertial loads are frequently concentrated on a limited number of bearings, gears, or rotary joints, leading to high localized stresses and accelerated wear. For deployable antennas, additional load paths introduced during deployment further increase mechanical complexity and susceptibility to misalignment or deformation.

Precision requirements impose additional constraints on antenna actuation. Large antennas often demand high pointing accuracy and long-term stability, particularly for high-gain communication or scientific observation missions. Achieving such precision requires drive systems with high stiffness, minimal backlash, and robust resistance to environmental disturbances. These requirements are difficult to satisfy using traditional actuation architectures without excessive structural reinforcement or complex compensation mechanisms.

Furthermore, deployable antenna systems introduce unique configuration-dependent challenges. During deployment and post-deployment operation, the structural configuration of the antenna changes, altering its mass distribution and stiffness characteristics. Actuation systems must therefore operate reliably across varying load conditions and structural states, which places stringent demands on adaptability and robustness.

In summary, the structural and actuation challenges of large satellite and deployable antennas extend beyond those encountered in conventional robotic or motion control applications. These challenges underscore the need for advanced actuation solutions capable of providing high load capacity, uniform force distribution, and precise multi-axis control, motivating the exploration of optimized parallel robot architectures for large antenna driving systems.

* Mass, inertia, pointing accuracy requirements
The mass and inertia characteristics of large satellite and deployable antennas impose stringent and often conflicting requirements on their driving mechanisms. As antenna aperture increases, both the total mass and the spatial distribution of mass grow significantly, resulting in large translational and rotational inertia. For antennas with diameters on the order of 12 m, the inertia about the elevation and azimuth axes becomes a dominant factor governing actuator sizing, structural stiffness, and dynamic performance.

High rotational inertia directly affects the torque and force demands of the actuation system. Even modest angular accelerations during pointing or tracking maneuvers can generate substantial inertial loads, which must be supported continuously by the drive mechanism. In many existing antenna systems, these inertial effects necessitate oversized actuators and transmission elements, increasing system mass and reducing efficiency. Moreover, large inertia amplifies the sensitivity of the system to structural compliance, leading to degraded dynamic response and increased settling time.

Pointing accuracy requirements further intensify these challenges. Large-aperture antennas are typically required to achieve high angular precision and long-term stability, particularly in high-frequency communication and scientific observation missions. For such applications, pointing errors on the order of millidegrees or even arc-seconds may be unacceptable. Any elastic deformation, backlash, or uneven load distribution within the actuation system can directly translate into angular misalignment at the antenna aperture, resulting in significant signal degradation.

The coupling between mass, inertia, and pointing accuracy is particularly critical. High inertia not only increases actuator force requirements but also exacerbates vibration and oscillatory behavior during motion. These dynamic effects can interact with the flexible modes of large antenna structures, making it difficult to achieve fast and accurate pointing without inducing residual vibration. Consequently, antenna drive mechanisms must exhibit high stiffness and damping characteristics while maintaining precise multi-axis controllability.

In deployable antenna systems, these requirements are further complicated by configuration-dependent mass distribution. During deployment and operational phases, the antenna’s center of mass and inertia tensor may vary, altering the load conditions experienced by the drive system. Actuation mechanisms must therefore maintain pointing accuracy and stability across a range of inertia states, placing additional demands on structural robustness and force transmission capability.

Existing antenna drive solutions often address these requirements through conservative design approaches, such as increasing structural rigidity or actuator capacity. While effective, such methods lead to increased system mass and reduced scalability. As antenna size continues to grow, these trade-offs become increasingly unfavorable, highlighting the need for actuation architectures that can efficiently manage large mass and inertia while preserving high pointing accuracy through intelligent structural design and optimization.

2.4 Optimization Methods in Parallel Robot Design

* PSO, GA, SQP, and hybrid approaches
Optimization methods play a central role in the structural design of parallel robots due to the strong coupling between geometric parameters, kinematic performance, and mechanical characteristics. Over the past decades, a variety of optimization algorithms have been applied to parallel robot design, ranging from classical gradient-based methods to modern population-based and hybrid approaches.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) have been widely used for structural parameter optimization because of their global search capability and robustness to nonlinear, nonconvex design spaces. In parallel robot applications, GA-based methods have been employed to optimize geometric parameters such as limb lengths, platform radii, and joint positions with respect to workspace volume, dexterity indices, and stiffness measures. The primary advantage of GA lies in its ability to avoid local optima without requiring gradient information. However, GA typically involves high computational cost and slow convergence, especially when multiple objectives and complex constraints are considered.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has emerged as an effective alternative to GA, offering faster convergence and simpler parameter tuning. PSO has been successfully applied to optimize parallel robot geometry with objectives including force transmission quality, workspace performance, and stiffness enhancement. The algorithm’s population-based nature allows it to handle multimodal objective functions efficiently. Nevertheless, PSO performance is sensitive to parameter selection and may still suffer from premature convergence in highly constrained design spaces.

In contrast, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) represents a class of gradient-based optimization methods that are particularly effective for problems with smooth objective functions and well-defined constraints. SQP has been applied to parallel robot optimization when analytical models of kinematics and statics are available. Its main strengths include fast local convergence and precise constraint handling. However, SQP is highly dependent on initial guesses and is prone to converging to local optima, which limits its applicability in complex, multi-objective structural optimization problems.

To leverage the complementary strengths of these algorithms, hybrid optimization approaches have been increasingly adopted. Typical hybrid strategies combine a global search algorithm, such as GA or PSO, with a local refinement method, such as SQP. In such frameworks, the global algorithm identifies promising regions of the design space, while the local optimizer refines the solution to achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence. Hybrid methods have demonstrated improved robustness and efficiency in parallel robot design, particularly for multi-objective and highly constrained problems.

Despite the effectiveness of these optimization techniques, most existing studies apply them to generic parallel robot design problems without explicitly incorporating application-specific constraints or large-payload considerations. Objective functions are often selected based on kinematic or stiffness indices alone, and payload mass and inertia are treated implicitly or neglected. For large-mass antenna actuation, optimization algorithms must operate within a framework that explicitly accounts for antenna-driven constraints and coupled performance metrics.

In summary, while PSO, GA, SQP, and hybrid optimization methods provide powerful tools for parallel robot design, their successful application to large antenna driving systems depends not only on algorithm selection but also on the formulation of application-oriented objective functions and constraints, which remains an open research challenge addressed in this work.

* Comparison of objective functions and constraints
The effectiveness of optimization methods in parallel robot design is fundamentally determined not only by the choice of algorithm but also by the selection of objective functions and constraints. These elements define the design intent and directly influence the feasibility and applicability of the optimized solution. Consequently, extensive research has been devoted to formulating appropriate optimization objectives and constraints for parallel mechanisms.

Commonly used objective functions in parallel robot optimization can be broadly classified into kinematic, mechanical, and hybrid categories. Kinematic objectives often include maximization of reachable or dexterous workspace, minimization of Jacobian condition number, and maximization of manipulability indices. These objectives aim to improve motion quality, numerical stability, and kinematic robustness, and they are particularly prevalent in early-stage design studies.

Mechanical objectives focus on force transmission efficiency and stiffness enhancement. Typical formulations involve minimizing peak actuator forces, maximizing global or local stiffness, or reducing compliance under external loads. Such objectives are critical for load-bearing applications and directly affect positioning accuracy and structural reliability. However, mechanical objectives are often more complex to evaluate, requiring detailed static or stiffness modeling, which has limited their adoption in some studies.

Hybrid objective functions attempt to balance kinematic and mechanical performance by combining multiple indices into a single weighted objective or formulating multi-objective optimization problems. Examples include simultaneous optimization of workspace volume and stiffness, or manipulability and actuator force limits. While these approaches offer a more comprehensive performance assessment, the selection of weighting factors or Pareto dominance criteria remains nontrivial and application-dependent.

In terms of constraints, most optimization studies impose geometric constraints, such as joint range limits, link length bounds, and collision avoidance conditions. Kinematic constraints, including singularity avoidance and workspace feasibility, are also commonly enforced. Actuator-related constraints, such as stroke limits and maximum force or torque capacity, are sometimes included but often treated conservatively.

Notably, many existing works apply generic constraints that are independent of specific application scenarios. Payload effects are frequently represented by simplified or normalized external loads, and the influence of payload mass distribution and inertia is rarely incorporated explicitly. This limitation is particularly significant for large-mass applications, where realistic loading conditions fundamentally alter force transmission and stiffness requirements.

For large-aperture antenna actuation, optimization objectives and constraints must reflect antenna-specific operational requirements, such as limited but precise angular motion, continuous load holding under gravity, and strict pointing accuracy. The lack of objective functions and constraints tailored to these requirements represents a critical gap in the current literature.

In summary, while a wide range of objective functions and constraints has been proposed for parallel robot optimization, existing formulations often lack the integration and application specificity required for large-mass antenna driving systems. This observation underscores the need for antenna-driven optimization frameworks that explicitly couple structural geometry, workspace capability, and force transmission performance under realistic loading conditions.

2.5 Summary and Identified Research Gap
This section has reviewed the existing literature on 6-DOF parallel robots, Stewart-type platforms, and their structural optimization, with particular emphasis on geometric parameter studies, force transmission and stiffness optimization, workspace-driven design approaches, and optimization algorithms. The review demonstrates that parallel mechanisms possess inherent advantages in load capacity, stiffness, and multi-degree-of-freedom motion, which have enabled their successful application in simulators, aerospace testing, and precision positioning systems.

However, the literature also reveals several critical limitations when these mechanisms are considered for large-mass, large-aperture antenna actuation. Most existing studies address parallel robot design from a general-purpose perspective, focusing primarily on kinematic performance or isolated mechanical indices. The specific challenges associated with driving large antennas—such as substantial mass and inertia, coupled force–moment loading, and stringent pointing accuracy requirements—are rarely incorporated explicitly into structural optimization frameworks.

In particular, current geometric parameter optimization studies tend to emphasize workspace enlargement or kinematic conditioning, often neglecting the force transmission and stiffness requirements imposed by heavy payloads. Similarly, force and stiffness optimization efforts frequently rely on simplified loading assumptions that fail to capture the realistic operating conditions of large antenna systems. Workspace-driven design approaches, while effective for ensuring motion feasibility, do not adequately account for the mechanical constraints that dominate antenna actuation performance.

Although advanced optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and hybrid strategies, have been widely applied to parallel robot design, their effectiveness is ultimately constrained by the formulation of objective functions and constraints. Existing formulations generally lack integration and application specificity, treating workspace, stiffness, and force transmission as loosely coupled objectives and neglecting the influence of antenna mass distribution and inertia.

Based on this analysis, a clear research gap can be identified: there is a lack of integrated, application-driven structural optimization methodologies for 6-DOF parallel robots that explicitly account for the mass, inertia, and performance requirements of large-aperture antenna actuation. Addressing this gap requires a unified framework that couples geometric configuration, workspace capability, and force transmission performance under realistic antenna-driven loading conditions.

The present study aims to fill this gap by developing a parametric structural model of a 6-DOF parallel robot tailored to a 12 m-class satellite antenna and by proposing an integrated multi-objective optimization approach. This framework is designed to achieve balanced performance improvements while ensuring mechanical feasibility and robustness, thereby advancing the practical application of parallel robots in large antenna driving systems.

3. System Description and Design Requirements

3.1 Application Scenario: 12 m Satellite Antenna

* Antenna mass, center of gravity, inertia characteristics
The application considered in this study is the driving and positioning of a large-aperture satellite antenna with a reflector diameter of 12 m. Antennas of this scale are commonly employed in high-gain communication and scientific observation systems, where stringent requirements are imposed on pointing accuracy, structural stability, and long-term operational reliability.

From a mechanical standpoint, the antenna constitutes a large-mass payload with a spatially distributed mass and significant rotational inertia. Unlike compact end-effectors, the mass of a large antenna is spread over a wide area, resulting in high moments of inertia about the principal axes. These inertia characteristics play a dominant role in determining the force and torque demands placed on the driving mechanism, particularly during pointing and tracking maneuvers.

The center of gravity (CoG) of the antenna is another critical factor influencing system behavior. Due to the reflector geometry, supporting truss structures, and feed assemblies, the CoG is generally offset from the geometric center of the reflector. This offset generates additional moments under gravitational loading, which must be continuously supported by the actuation system. Any variation in antenna configuration or operational orientation can further alter the effective CoG location, complicating load management.

The inertia tensor of the antenna reflects both its size and mass distribution. For large-aperture antennas, the principal moments of inertia about the elevation and azimuth axes are typically several orders of magnitude greater than those encountered in conventional robotic applications. These large inertia values amplify dynamic effects, such as acceleration-induced forces and vibration, and increase sensitivity to structural compliance within the drive mechanism.

To accurately capture these effects, the antenna in this study is modeled as a rigid body characterized by its total mass, CoG location, and inertia tensor. This modeling approach enables realistic evaluation of gravitational and inertial loads acting on the driving mechanism while maintaining computational efficiency. The resulting antenna model provides a physically meaningful basis for defining design requirements and performance constraints in the subsequent optimization process.

In summary, the large mass, distributed inertia, and non-negligible CoG offset of the 12 m satellite antenna impose stringent mechanical demands on the actuation system. These characteristics motivate the adoption of a high-stiffness, multi-degree-of-freedom driving mechanism and form the foundation for the structural parameter optimization framework developed in this study.

* Required motion range, precision, and operational constraints
The driving mechanism for a 12 m-class satellite antenna must satisfy a set of stringent motion and precision requirements dictated by mission objectives and operational conditions. Unlike general-purpose robotic systems, antenna actuation typically involves limited but highly accurate spatial motions, with emphasis on stability and repeatability rather than large-range displacement.

In terms of motion range, large satellite antennas primarily require rotational motion for pointing and tracking purposes. The azimuth and elevation angles must cover sufficient ranges to ensure continuous target acquisition and tracking across the operational field of view. Although translational motion is generally limited, small translational adjustments may be required to compensate for structural deformation, installation misalignment, or thermal expansion. Consequently, the actuation system must provide full six-degree-of-freedom motion, albeit within a constrained workspace tailored to antenna-specific tasks.

Pointing precision represents one of the most critical performance requirements. High-gain antennas demand extremely accurate orientation control to maintain signal quality, particularly at high operating frequencies. Angular positioning accuracy on the order of millidegrees or arc-seconds is often required, along with high repeatability and minimal drift over extended operation periods. These requirements impose strict limits on allowable structural deformation, actuator backlash, and control-induced error.

Operational constraints further complicate the design of the driving mechanism. During tracking operations, the antenna must execute smooth and continuous motion with minimal vibration to avoid signal interruption. Rapid acceleration and deceleration should be avoided, as they can excite flexible modes of the antenna structure and degrade pointing accuracy. At the same time, the actuation system must be capable of holding the antenna at fixed orientations for extended durations while resisting gravitational and environmental disturbances.

Environmental and operational factors also influence design requirements. For ground-based systems, wind loads and temperature variations introduce additional disturbances that must be accommodated. In spaceborne or deployable antenna systems, thermal gradients and microgravity conditions affect structural behavior and load distribution. The drive mechanism must therefore maintain reliable performance under varying load conditions and across different operational environments.

These motion, precision, and operational requirements collectively impose stringent constraints on the actuation system design. They necessitate a mechanism capable of precise multi-axis control, high structural stiffness, and robust force transmission, while operating within a limited and well-defined workspace. These requirements form the basis for the antenna-driven performance constraints employed in the structural modeling and optimization framework presented in this paper.

3.2 Conceptual Design of the 6-DOF Parallel Robot

* Chosen architecture (e.g., 6-UPS, 6-RUS, or equivalent)
In this study, a typical Stewart platform is selected as the actuation architecture for driving and positioning the 12 m satellite antenna. The Stewart platform is a classical 6-DOF parallel mechanism consisting of six independently actuated extensible limbs connecting a fixed base to a moving platform. Each limb forms a closed kinematic chain through appropriate joint combinations, enabling the moving platform to achieve full spatial motion.

The selection of the Stewart platform is primarily motivated by its structural symmetry, high stiffness, and proven load-bearing capability, which are essential for large-mass antenna actuation. The symmetric arrangement of the six limbs facilitates uniform force distribution and balanced load sharing among actuators, reducing peak stresses and enhancing structural reliability under large gravitational and inertial loads.

From a kinematic perspective, the Stewart platform provides complete decoupling of translational and rotational motion at the task level, allowing precise control of the antenna’s position and orientation within a compact workspace. Unlike serial architectures, the closed-loop structure minimizes error accumulation and improves positioning accuracy, which is critical for high-precision antenna pointing applications.

In terms of actuation layout, the typical Stewart platform allows actuators to be mounted on or near the fixed base, significantly reducing the moving mass of the system. This configuration improves dynamic response and reduces inertial coupling during motion, which is particularly advantageous when driving a large and heavy antenna. Additionally, the extensible limbs can be designed to accommodate the required motion range while maintaining high structural stiffness.

The chosen Stewart platform architecture also offers flexibility in structural parameterization, including base and platform radii, limb lengths, and joint attachment positions. This flexibility is essential for optimization-driven design, as it enables systematic adjustment of geometric parameters to balance workspace capability, force transmission efficiency, and stiffness performance under antenna-specific loading conditions.

Although alternative 6-DOF parallel configurations exist, such as 6-RUS or 6-SPS mechanisms, the typical Stewart platform provides a well-established theoretical foundation and a favorable balance between mechanical performance and modeling complexity. Its extensive use in high-load and high-precision applications further supports its suitability for large-aperture antenna actuation.

Based on these considerations, the typical Stewart platform is adopted in this study as the fundamental actuation architecture. The subsequent sections focus on its detailed modeling and structural parameter optimization to meet the stringent requirements imposed by the 12 m satellite antenna.

3.3 Coordinate Frames and Notation

* Base frame, moving platform frame
To facilitate the kinematic, static, and dynamic modeling of the Stewart platform, two Cartesian coordinate frames are defined: a fixed base frame and a moving platform frame. These frames provide a consistent reference for describing the geometry, motion, and force transmission characteristics of the parallel robot.

The base coordinate frame, denoted as ({B}), is fixed to the base of the Stewart platform. The origin (O_B) of this frame is located at the geometric center of the base platform. The axes ((x_B, y_B, z_B)) form a right-handed coordinate system, with the (z_B)-axis oriented normal to the base plane and pointing upward. The (x_B) and (y_B) axes lie in the base plane and are defined according to the symmetric arrangement of the limb attachment points.

The moving platform coordinate frame, denoted as ({P}), is attached to the moving platform that supports the antenna. The origin (O_P) is located at the geometric center of the moving platform. The axes ((x_P, y_P, z_P)) also form a right-handed coordinate system, with the (z_P)-axis normal to the moving platform surface. In the nominal configuration, the axes of ({P}) are aligned with those of ({B}).

The pose of the moving platform relative to the base frame is described by a position vector (\mathbf{r} = [x\ y\ z]^T), representing the coordinates of (O_P) expressed in ({B}), and a rotation matrix (\mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}), representing the orientation of ({P}) with respect to ({B}). The rotation matrix can be parameterized using Euler angles, roll–pitch–yaw angles, or other minimal orientation representations, depending on the modeling requirements.

The attachment points of the six limbs on the base platform are denoted by vectors (\mathbf{b}_i) ((i = 1, \dots, 6)), expressed in the base frame ({B}). Similarly, the attachment points on the moving platform are denoted by vectors (\mathbf{p}_i), expressed in the moving platform frame ({P}). These vectors are fixed and determined by the geometric design parameters of the Stewart platform.

Using the above notation, the spatial position of the (i)-th limb endpoint on the moving platform, expressed in the base frame, is given by:
[
\mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i.
]
This formulation provides the basis for deriving the inverse kinematics, Jacobian matrix, and force transmission relationships in subsequent sections.

By clearly defining coordinate frames and notation, a consistent mathematical framework is established for the modeling and optimization of the Stewart platform driving the large-aperture satellite antenna.


* Definition of geometric parameters
Based on the coordinate frames defined above, the geometric configuration of the Stewart platform is described using a set of parametric design variables that determine the spatial arrangement of the base and moving platforms, as well as the limb geometry. These parameters form the foundation for the structural modeling and optimization process.

The base platform geometry is characterized by a circular layout with radius (R_B). The six limb attachment points on the base are distributed symmetrically along the circumference of the base platform. Their positions in the base frame ({B}) are defined as:
[
\mathbf{b}_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_B \cos \theta_i \
R_B \sin \theta_i \
0
\end{bmatrix},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6,
]
where (\theta_i) denotes the angular position of the (i)-th attachment point. To avoid limb interference and improve load distribution, the attachment points are typically arranged in three symmetric pairs with predefined angular separations.

Similarly, the moving platform geometry is defined by a circular layout with radius (R_P). The attachment points on the moving platform are expressed in the moving frame ({P}) as:
[
\mathbf{p}_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_P \cos \phi_i \
R_P \sin \phi_i \
0
\end{bmatrix},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6,
]
where (\phi_i) represents the angular position of the (i)-th attachment point on the moving platform. The angular offsets between (\theta_i) and (\phi_i) are selected to enhance kinematic conditioning and reduce singularity risks.

The limb geometry is defined by the variable limb lengths (l_i), which are functions of the platform pose and the geometric parameters. For the (i)-th limb, the length is given by:
[
l_i = \left| \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{b}_i \right|,
]
where (|\cdot|) denotes the Euclidean norm. The allowable range of (l_i) is constrained by actuator stroke limits and mechanical design considerations.

In addition to the platform radii, other geometric parameters may be introduced to further characterize the Stewart platform configuration, such as:

* Angular separation between paired attachment points on the base and moving platforms
* Nominal platform height in the reference configuration
* Initial limb lengths at the home position

These parameters collectively define the structural design vector of the Stewart platform. By expressing the geometry in parametric form, the design space can be systematically explored through optimization, enabling the identification of configurations that best satisfy workspace, force transmission, and stiffness requirements under antenna-driven loading conditions.

3.4 Design Constraints and Performance Requirements

* Workspace limits
The workspace of the Stewart platform defines the set of attainable positions and orientations of the moving platform while satisfying all kinematic, mechanical, and actuator constraints. For large-aperture antenna actuation, workspace requirements are application-specific, emphasizing limited but precise motion rather than wide-ranging displacement.

The required workspace is determined by the antenna pointing and tracking tasks. Rotational motion about the elevation and azimuth axes constitutes the primary operational requirement, while translational motion is restricted to small ranges needed for alignment compensation and structural adjustment. Consequently, the workspace is defined as a bounded six-dimensional region consisting of limited translational displacements and angular rotations about the three principal axes.

To ensure feasible motion throughout the required workspace, the following workspace-related constraints are imposed:

1. Actuator Stroke Constraints
   Each limb length (l_i) must remain within the allowable actuator stroke limits:
   [
   l_i^{\min} \leq l_i(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}) \leq l_i^{\max}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
   ]
   These constraints restrict the reachable workspace and are directly influenced by the geometric design parameters.

2. Joint Range Constraints
   The angular motions of the passive joints at the base and moving platform are limited by mechanical design and joint type. For all configurations within the workspace, joint angles must remain within prescribed bounds to avoid mechanical interference and loss of controllability.

3. Singularity Avoidance Constraints
   Configurations that lead to kinematic singularities are excluded from the admissible workspace. Singularities degrade force transmission and controllability, making them unacceptable for antenna actuation. Therefore, the workspace is constrained to regions where the Jacobian matrix maintains full rank and acceptable conditioning.

4. Collision and Interference Constraints
   Limb–limb and limb–platform collisions must be avoided throughout the workspace. Minimum clearance distances are enforced to ensure safe operation and structural integrity, particularly under dynamic motion.

The workspace constraint is typically evaluated by sampling candidate configurations within the desired motion range and verifying feasibility against the above conditions. In the context of structural optimization, a design is considered acceptable only if the entire required antenna workspace is achievable without violating any workspace-related constraints.

By explicitly incorporating workspace limits into the design constraints, the optimization process ensures that the resulting Stewart platform configuration is not only mechanically robust but also fully capable of meeting the antenna’s operational motion requirements.

* Load capacity
Load capacity represents a fundamental performance requirement for the Stewart platform driving the 12 m satellite antenna. The actuation system must be capable of supporting the antenna mass and resisting external and inertial loads throughout the entire operational workspace without exceeding actuator or structural limits.

The primary load acting on the system is the gravitational force generated by the antenna mass. Due to the large size and distributed mass of the antenna, this force produces not only vertical loading but also significant moments about the moving platform, particularly when the center of gravity is offset from the platform origin. These moments must be balanced by coordinated force generation across the six limbs of the Stewart platform.

In addition to static gravitational loading, the system must accommodate dynamic loads arising from antenna motion. During pointing and tracking operations, angular acceleration induces inertial forces and moments proportional to the antenna’s mass and inertia tensor. Although such motions are typically slow, the large inertia associated with a 12 m antenna can result in non-negligible dynamic loading that must be considered in the design.

The load capacity constraint is formulated by limiting the actuator forces within their allowable ranges. For each limb, the axial force (f_i) must satisfy:
[
|f_i| \leq f_i^{\max}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 6,
]
where (f_i^{\max}) denotes the maximum permissible force of the actuator, accounting for both tensile and compressive limits.

The relationship between the external load acting on the antenna and the actuator forces is governed by the static equilibrium equation:
[
\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{w},
]
where (\mathbf{J}) is the Jacobian matrix of the Stewart platform, (\mathbf{f} = [f_1 \ \dots \ f_6]^T) is the vector of actuator forces, and (\mathbf{w}) represents the external wrench applied to the moving platform, including gravitational and inertial components.

To ensure safe and reliable operation, the load capacity constraint must be satisfied for all configurations within the required workspace and under worst-case loading conditions. Designs that result in excessive actuator forces or uneven load distribution are considered infeasible, even if other performance criteria are met.

By explicitly incorporating load capacity constraints into the design requirements, the optimization framework ensures that the Stewart platform can robustly support the large mass and inertia of the antenna while maintaining mechanical integrity and operational safety.

* Stiffness and deflection limits
High structural stiffness and minimal deflection are critical performance requirements for the Stewart platform driving a large-aperture satellite antenna. Due to the stringent pointing accuracy demands of high-gain antennas, even small elastic deformations within the actuation system can lead to unacceptable orientation errors at the antenna aperture.

Under operational conditions, the Stewart platform is subjected to static loads, primarily due to the antenna’s weight, as well as dynamic loads induced by motion and environmental disturbances. These loads cause elastic deformation of the limbs, joints, and platform structures, which collectively contribute to displacement and rotation errors of the moving platform.

To quantify stiffness performance, the relationship between an external wrench (\mathbf{w}) applied to the moving platform and the resulting small displacement vector (\boldsymbol{\delta}) is expressed as:
[
\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{K} \boldsymbol{\delta},
]
where (\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{6 \times 6}) is the global stiffness matrix of the Stewart platform. This matrix depends on the geometric configuration, limb stiffness properties, and Jacobian matrix of the mechanism.

The global stiffness matrix can be approximated as:
[
\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{J}^{-T} \mathbf{K}_l \mathbf{J}^{-1},
]
where (\mathbf{K}_l) is a diagonal matrix containing the axial stiffness of the six limbs, and (\mathbf{J}) is the Jacobian matrix. This formulation highlights the strong dependence of stiffness on both geometric parameters and kinematic conditioning.

The stiffness and deflection constraints are imposed by limiting the allowable translational and rotational deflections of the moving platform under worst-case loading conditions:
[
|\boldsymbol{\delta}_t| \leq \delta_t^{\max}, \quad
|\boldsymbol{\delta}_r| \leq \delta_r^{\max},
]
where (\boldsymbol{\delta}_t) and (\boldsymbol{\delta}_r) denote translational and rotational deflections, respectively, and (\delta_t^{\max}), (\delta_r^{\max}) represent the maximum permissible deflections determined by antenna pointing accuracy requirements.

For large-aperture antennas, rotational deflection limits are typically more stringent than translational limits, as small angular errors can result in significant pointing deviations at the antenna aperture. Therefore, rotational stiffness plays a dominant role in the design and optimization of the Stewart platform.

These stiffness and deflection constraints must be satisfied across the entire required workspace, ensuring consistent performance regardless of antenna orientation. Designs that exhibit high stiffness in only a limited region of the workspace are considered unsuitable for reliable antenna operation.

By explicitly incorporating stiffness and deflection limits into the design constraints, the proposed optimization framework ensures that the resulting Stewart platform configuration achieves the necessary balance between structural rigidity, load-bearing capability, and precise antenna pointing performance.

* Actuator stroke and force limits
The performance and feasibility of the Stewart platform are strongly constrained by the physical limitations of its actuators. For the large-aperture antenna application considered in this study, actuator stroke and force limits play a decisive role in determining the admissible workspace and load-bearing capability of the system.

Each limb of the Stewart platform incorporates a linear actuator that provides controlled extension and retraction. The stroke limit of the actuator restricts the range of limb lengths and, consequently, the reachable positions and orientations of the moving platform. For all configurations within the required workspace, the actuator length (l_i) must satisfy:
[
l_i^{\min} \leq l_i \leq l_i^{\max}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 6,
]
where (l_i^{\min}) and (l_i^{\max}) denote the minimum and maximum allowable actuator lengths, respectively. These bounds are determined by actuator design, mechanical packaging, and safety considerations.

In addition to stroke constraints, each actuator is subject to force capacity limits. The axial force generated by the (i)-th actuator, (f_i), must remain within its allowable operating range:
[
|f_i| \leq f_i^{\max},
]
where (f_i^{\max}) represents the maximum permissible force, accounting for continuous operation limits, thermal constraints, and structural safety margins.

The actuator forces are governed by the static equilibrium of the moving platform under external loading, which can be expressed as:
[
\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{w},
]
where (\mathbf{J}) is the Jacobian matrix of the Stewart platform, (\mathbf{f}) is the vector of actuator forces, and (\mathbf{w}) denotes the external wrench acting on the moving platform, including gravitational and inertial effects from the antenna.

These stroke and force constraints are evaluated across the entire required workspace and under worst-case loading conditions. Particular attention is given to configurations that result in uneven load distribution or near-singular Jacobian matrices, as such conditions can lead to excessive actuator forces or reduced control authority.

By enforcing actuator stroke and force limits as explicit constraints in the design process, the optimization framework ensures that the resulting Stewart platform configuration is mechanically realizable, safely operable, and capable of supporting the large mass and inertia of the 12 m satellite antenna without actuator saturation or structural overload.

4. Kinematic and Static Modeling

4.1 Inverse Kinematic Model

* Mathematical formulation
The inverse kinematic problem of the Stewart platform consists of determining the required actuator lengths for a given pose of the moving platform. In the context of antenna actuation, this formulation is essential for evaluating workspace feasibility, actuator stroke limits, and force transmission performance.

Let the pose of the moving platform be defined by the position vector
[
\mathbf{r} = [x ; y ; z]^T
]
of the moving platform origin (O_P) expressed in the base frame ({B}), and by the rotation matrix
[
\mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}
]
representing the orientation of the moving platform frame ({P}) with respect to the base frame ({B}).

The position of the (i)-th attachment point on the moving platform, expressed in the base frame, is given by:
[
\mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R} \mathbf{p}_i,
]
where (\mathbf{p}_i) denotes the position vector of the (i)-th attachment point in the moving platform frame.

The position of the corresponding attachment point on the base platform is denoted by (\mathbf{b}_i), expressed in the base frame.

The vector describing the (i)-th limb is therefore:
[
\mathbf{l}_i = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R} \mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{b}_i.
]

The length of the (i)-th actuator is obtained as the Euclidean norm of this vector:
[
l_i = \left| \mathbf{l}_i \right| = \left| \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R} \mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{b}_i \right|,
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]

This set of equations constitutes the inverse kinematic model of the Stewart platform. For a given platform pose ((\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R})), the required actuator lengths (l_i) can be computed directly and independently for each limb, making the inverse kinematics computationally efficient and well suited for optimization and real-time evaluation.

The inverse kinematic formulation provides the basis for:

* Verifying actuator stroke constraints across the required workspace
* Evaluating Jacobian matrices and kinematic conditioning
* Establishing the relationship between platform motion and actuator motion

These capabilities are essential for subsequent static force analysis and structural parameter optimization of the Stewart platform under large-antenna loading conditions.

* Actuator length expressions
Based on the geometric definitions and coordinate frames introduced in Section 3, the actuator length of each limb in the Stewart platform can be expressed explicitly as a function of the moving platform pose.

For the (i)-th limb, the position vector of the attachment point on the moving platform, expressed in the base frame, is given by:
[
\mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i,
]
where (\mathbf{r}) is the position vector of the moving platform origin and (\mathbf{R}) is the rotation matrix describing the platform orientation.

The corresponding attachment point on the base platform is denoted by (\mathbf{b}_i). The limb vector (\mathbf{l}_i) is therefore:
[
\mathbf{l}_i = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{b}_i.
]

The actuator length (l_i) is defined as the magnitude of this vector:
[
l_i = \sqrt{\left( \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{b}_i \right)^T
\left( \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{b}_i \right)},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]

For computational convenience, the unit direction vector of the (i)-th limb is defined as:
[
\hat{\mathbf{u}}_i = \frac{\mathbf{l}_i}{l_i}.
]

These actuator length expressions form the core of the inverse kinematic model and enable direct evaluation of:

* Actuator stroke utilization across the workspace
* Sensitivity of limb lengths to platform motion
* Kinematic feasibility under geometric constraints

Furthermore, the explicit formulation of (l_i) allows seamless integration into the Jacobian matrix derivation and static force analysis presented in subsequent sections.

4.2 Workspace Analysis

* Reachable and usable workspace
Workspace analysis is a fundamental step in evaluating the feasibility of the Stewart platform for large-aperture antenna actuation. In this study, the workspace is classified into reachable workspace and usable workspace, reflecting the distinction between kinematic reachability and practical operability under mechanical and performance constraints.

The reachable workspace is defined as the set of all platform poses that can be attained purely from a kinematic perspective, considering only the inverse kinematic solutions and actuator stroke limits. A platform pose ((\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R})) belongs to the reachable workspace if the corresponding actuator lengths (l_i) satisfy:
[
l_i^{\min} \leq l_i(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}) \leq l_i^{\max}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]
This workspace represents the maximum motion capability of the mechanism without regard to force, stiffness, or accuracy considerations.

However, for large-mass antenna applications, kinematic reachability alone is insufficient. The usable workspace is therefore introduced as a more restrictive and practically meaningful subset of the reachable workspace. A pose is considered usable only if, in addition to kinematic feasibility, all mechanical and performance constraints are satisfied.

Specifically, the usable workspace is defined by enforcing the following conditions:

* Actuator force limits, ensuring that the static forces required to balance gravitational and inertial loads do not exceed actuator capacity.
* Stiffness and deflection constraints, guaranteeing that platform deformation remains within allowable limits to maintain pointing accuracy.
* Singularity avoidance, excluding configurations with poor kinematic conditioning or loss of controllability.
* Joint and collision constraints, preventing mechanical interference or joint overextension.

The usable workspace is evaluated by sampling candidate poses within the desired motion range and verifying constraint satisfaction at each configuration. For antenna actuation, emphasis is placed on the continuity and robustness of the usable workspace, ensuring that all required pointing and tracking motions can be executed smoothly and safely.

By distinguishing between reachable and usable workspace, this analysis provides a realistic assessment of the Stewart platform’s operational capability. This distinction is particularly important for optimization-driven design, as configurations that maximize reachable workspace may perform poorly under load or stiffness constraints, whereas designs optimized for usable workspace ensure reliable and precise antenna operation.

* Orientation capability under load
For large-aperture antenna actuation, the ability of the Stewart platform to achieve and maintain required orientations under significant payload loading is a key performance criterion. Unlike conventional workspace analysis that considers only kinematic reachability, orientation capability under load explicitly accounts for the interaction between platform orientation, external loading, and actuator force capacity.

The antenna orientation is described by the rotation matrix (\mathbf{R}), which determines the direction of the gravitational load and the resulting moment acting on the moving platform. As the antenna tilts away from the nominal upright configuration, the gravitational force generates increasing overturning moments due to the offset between the antenna center of gravity and the platform reference point. These moments must be balanced by coordinated actuator forces within the Stewart platform.

For a given orientation (\mathbf{R}), the external wrench acting on the moving platform can be expressed as:
[
\mathbf{w} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{F}_g \
\mathbf{M}_g
\end{bmatrix},
]
where (\mathbf{F}_g) denotes the gravitational force and (\mathbf{M}_g) represents the moment induced by the gravitational load about the platform origin.

The feasibility of a given orientation under load is determined by the static equilibrium condition:
[
\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{w},
]
subject to actuator force limits:
[
|f_i| \leq f_i^{\max}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]
If no admissible actuator force vector (\mathbf{f}) exists that satisfies these constraints, the corresponding orientation is considered infeasible under load, even if it is kinematically reachable.

As antenna orientation varies, the Jacobian matrix (\mathbf{J}) also changes, affecting force transmission efficiency and load distribution among the actuators. Orientations associated with poor Jacobian conditioning can lead to highly uneven force sharing and actuator saturation, thereby reducing the usable orientation range.

The orientation workspace under load is therefore defined as the set of all orientations for which static equilibrium can be maintained without violating actuator force and stiffness constraints. This orientation workspace is generally smaller than the purely kinematic orientation workspace and may be highly asymmetric due to gravity-induced loading.

Evaluating orientation capability under load is particularly important for large antennas, where allowable angular motion may be limited not by kinematics but by actuator force capacity and structural stiffness. This analysis provides critical insight into the trade-offs between geometric configuration and load-bearing performance and directly informs the structural parameter optimization process.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Explicitly accounts for gravity-induced moments
✔ Couples orientation, Jacobian, and force limits
✔ Distinguishes kinematic vs. load-feasible orientations
✔ Highly relevant for large antenna pointing

4.3 Jacobian Matrix and Singularity Analysis

* Velocity mapping
The Jacobian matrix of the Stewart platform establishes the relationship between the velocity of the moving platform and the rates of change of the actuator lengths. This velocity mapping is fundamental for analyzing kinematic performance, force transmission, stiffness characteristics, and singular configurations.

Let the twist vector of the moving platform be defined as:
[
\boldsymbol{\xi} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v} \
\boldsymbol{\omega}
\end{bmatrix}
\in \mathbb{R}^6,
]
where (\mathbf{v}) denotes the linear velocity of the moving platform origin (O_P), and (\boldsymbol{\omega}) represents the angular velocity of the moving platform, both expressed in the base frame ({B}).

The time derivative of the (i)-th actuator length (l_i) can be expressed as:
[
\dot{l}_i = \hat{\mathbf{u}}_i^T
\left( \mathbf{v} + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times (\mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i) \right),
]
where (\hat{\mathbf{u}}_i) is the unit direction vector of the (i)-th limb, and (\mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}_i) represents the position vector of the attachment point on the moving platform expressed in the base frame.

By assembling the actuator rate equations for all six limbs, the velocity mapping can be written in matrix form as:
[
\dot{\mathbf{l}} = \mathbf{J} \boldsymbol{\xi},
]
where (\dot{\mathbf{l}} = [\dot{l}_1 ; \dot{l}_2 ; \dots ; \dot{l}_6]^T) is the vector of actuator length rates, and (\mathbf{J} \in \mathbb{R}^{6 \times 6}) is the Jacobian matrix of the Stewart platform.

The (i)-th row of the Jacobian matrix is given by:
[
\mathbf{J}_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf{u}}_i^T & \hat{\mathbf{u}}*i^T \left[ \mathbf{R}\mathbf{p}*i \right]*\times
\end{bmatrix},
]
where ([\cdot]*\times) denotes the skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to the cross-product operation.

This Jacobian formulation clearly illustrates how platform translational and rotational velocities contribute to actuator length rates. It also reveals the dependence of the velocity mapping on the geometric configuration and orientation of the Stewart platform.

The Jacobian matrix plays a central role in identifying kinematic singularities, which occur when (\mathbf{J}) loses rank. At or near singular configurations, certain platform motions cannot be generated or controlled effectively, leading to degraded velocity transmission, excessive actuator velocities, and poor force distribution. Such configurations are particularly undesirable for large-aperture antenna actuation, where smooth, stable motion and reliable force transmission are essential.

The velocity mapping provided by the Jacobian matrix therefore serves as a foundation for singularity analysis, force transmission evaluation, and stiffness modeling in subsequent sections.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Clear and standard velocity mapping formulation
✔ Explicit Jacobian row definition
✔ Direct link to singularity and force analysis
✔ Essential for precision and stability evaluation

* Identification of singular configurations
Singular configurations of a Stewart platform correspond to poses at which the mechanism loses controllability or force transmission capability. In such configurations, the Jacobian matrix becomes rank deficient, resulting in degraded velocity mapping, unbounded actuator forces, or loss of stiffness. Identifying and avoiding singular configurations is therefore essential for reliable operation, particularly in large-mass antenna applications.

Based on the Jacobian matrix (\mathbf{J}) defined in the previous subsection, a configuration is considered kinematically singular if:
[
\det(\mathbf{J}) = 0
\quad \text{or} \quad
\text{rank}(\mathbf{J}) < 6.
]
At these configurations, at least one degree of freedom of the moving platform becomes uncontrollable or requires infinite actuator velocity.

Singularities in Stewart platforms are commonly classified into two main categories:

1. Forward (Platform) Singularities

Forward singularities occur when the moving platform gains one or more unconstrained instantaneous motions despite all actuators being locked. In this case, the platform can move infinitesimally without requiring changes in actuator lengths. Physically, this corresponds to a loss of stiffness in certain directions.

Mathematically, forward singularities arise when the rows of the Jacobian matrix become linearly dependent, causing the transpose Jacobian (\mathbf{J}^T) to lose rank. In such configurations, the platform cannot resist certain external wrenches, leading to large deflections under load.

For large-aperture antennas, forward singularities are particularly dangerous, as they can result in severe pointing errors or structural instability even under static gravitational loading.

2. Inverse (Actuator) Singularities

Inverse singularities occur when the platform loses the ability to generate certain motions, even though the actuators are capable of extension or retraction. In this case, specific platform velocity components cannot be produced regardless of actuator velocity commands.

These singularities are associated with linear dependence among the columns of the Jacobian matrix. Near inverse singularities, small platform motions may require excessively large actuator velocities, leading to poor controllability and increased risk of actuator saturation.

Singularity Measures and Identification Criteria

To quantitatively assess proximity to singular configurations, several scalar indices derived from the Jacobian matrix are commonly employed, including:

* Determinant of the Jacobian, indicating loss of rank
* Condition number of the Jacobian, reflecting sensitivity and numerical stability
* Minimum singular value, representing the weakest motion or force transmission direction

In this study, singular configurations are identified by monitoring these indices across the workspace. Configurations with poor Jacobian conditioning or singularity indicators exceeding predefined thresholds are excluded from the usable workspace.

Relevance to Antenna Actuation

Due to the high payload mass and strict pointing accuracy requirements, antenna actuation systems must operate well away from singular configurations. Near-singular poses not only degrade kinematic performance but also amplify actuator forces and reduce structural stiffness, making them unacceptable for large antenna driving tasks.

Accordingly, singularity avoidance is treated as a fundamental constraint in the design and optimization of the Stewart platform presented in this work.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Clear classification of singularities
✔ Links mathematical conditions to physical behavior
✔ Uses standard Jacobian-based criteria
✔ Strongly tied to load and stiffness concerns

4.4 Static Force and Load Distribution Analysis

* Actuator force calculation under antenna loads
Static force analysis is essential for evaluating the load-bearing capability of the Stewart platform when supporting a large-aperture antenna. The objective of this analysis is to determine the actuator forces required to maintain static equilibrium of the moving platform under antenna-induced loads and to assess the resulting load distribution among the six actuators.

The external load acting on the moving platform is represented by a wrench vector:
[
\mathbf{w} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{F} \
\mathbf{M}
\end{bmatrix}
\in \mathbb{R}^6,
]
where (\mathbf{F}) denotes the resultant force applied at the platform origin and (\mathbf{M}) represents the resultant moment. For the antenna application, the dominant contribution to (\mathbf{w}) is the gravitational load of the antenna, supplemented by inertial loads when quasi-static motion is considered.

The gravitational force acting on the antenna is given by:
[
\mathbf{F}_g = m_a \mathbf{g},
]
where (m_a) is the antenna mass and (\mathbf{g}) is the gravitational acceleration vector expressed in the base frame. The corresponding gravitational moment about the moving platform origin is:
[
\mathbf{M}*g = \mathbf{r}*{cg} \times \mathbf{F}*g,
]
where (\mathbf{r}*{cg}) denotes the vector from the platform origin to the antenna center of gravity.

Under static equilibrium conditions, the actuator forces must balance the external wrench acting on the moving platform. This relationship is expressed through the transpose of the Jacobian matrix:
[
\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{w},
]
where (\mathbf{f} = [f_1 ; f_2 ; \dots ; f_6]^T) is the vector of axial actuator forces.

Provided that the Jacobian matrix is nonsingular, the actuator forces can be obtained as:
[
\mathbf{f} = (\mathbf{J}^T)^{-1} \mathbf{w}.
]
This expression enables direct computation of actuator forces for any given platform pose and antenna load condition.

The resulting actuator forces reflect the load distribution characteristics of the Stewart platform. Due to geometric asymmetry, gravity orientation, and center-of-gravity offset, load sharing among actuators is generally nonuniform. Certain configurations may lead to force concentration in specific limbs, increasing the risk of actuator saturation or structural overstress.

For large-aperture antennas, maintaining balanced load distribution is particularly important, as excessive forces in individual actuators can compromise reliability and long-term performance. Therefore, actuator force magnitudes and distribution patterns are evaluated across the entire usable workspace to identify critical configurations and to inform the structural parameter optimization process.

This static force analysis provides a quantitative basis for enforcing actuator force constraints and for assessing the mechanical feasibility of candidate Stewart platform designs under realistic antenna loading conditions.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Uses standard static equilibrium formulation
✔ Explicitly includes antenna mass and CoG effects
✔ Highlights load distribution issues
✔ Directly supports force-based optimization objectives

* Worst-case loading scenarios
To ensure safe and reliable operation of the Stewart platform under all anticipated conditions, actuator forces and structural responses must be evaluated under worst-case loading scenarios. These scenarios represent the most demanding combinations of antenna orientation, gravitational loading, and geometric configuration within the usable workspace.

The primary contributor to worst-case loading in large-aperture antenna systems is gravity acting on a large mass with an offset center of gravity. As the antenna tilts away from the nominal upright configuration, the gravitational force produces increasing moments about the moving platform origin, leading to elevated actuator forces and uneven load distribution.

The following worst-case loading scenarios are considered in this study:

1. Maximum Tilt Orientation under Gravity

The most severe static loading typically occurs when the antenna reaches its maximum allowable tilt angle. In this configuration, the gravitational force vector generates the largest overturning moment due to the increased horizontal projection of the center-of-gravity offset.

For a given maximum tilt angle (\theta_{\max}), the external wrench is expressed as:
[
\mathbf{w}*{\max} =
\begin{bmatrix}
m_a \mathbf{g} \
\mathbf{r}*{cg} \times m_a \mathbf{g}
\end{bmatrix},
]
where (m_a) is the antenna mass and (\mathbf{r}_{cg}) is the center-of-gravity offset vector.

This scenario is critical for identifying actuator force peaks and assessing the adequacy of force margins.

2. Workspace Boundary Configurations

Worst-case actuator forces often occur near the boundary of the usable workspace, where geometric leverage effects reduce force transmission efficiency. At these configurations, the Jacobian matrix may become poorly conditioned, leading to force amplification in certain actuators.

Evaluating static equilibrium at workspace boundaries ensures that actuator force limits are not violated at the extremities of the required motion range.

3. Unfavorable Center-of-Gravity Alignment

In some orientations, the projection of the center of gravity aligns unfavorably with specific limb directions, resulting in highly asymmetric load distribution. Such configurations can cause one or two actuators to carry a disproportionate share of the total load.

These scenarios are particularly important for large antennas, where even modest asymmetry in load sharing can significantly affect actuator sizing and fatigue life.

4. Quasi-Static Dynamic Effects

Although antenna motion is generally slow, quasi-static inertial loads due to acceleration and deceleration can add to gravitational loading. The combined external wrench in such cases is given by:
[
\mathbf{w} =
\begin{bmatrix}
m_a (\mathbf{g} + \mathbf{a}) \
\mathbf{r}_{cg} \times m_a (\mathbf{g} + \mathbf{a})
\end{bmatrix},
]
where (\mathbf{a}) denotes the platform acceleration vector.

Including these effects provides a conservative estimate of actuator forces during transient motion.

Significance for Design and Optimization

By evaluating the Stewart platform under these worst-case loading scenarios, the static force analysis captures the most demanding operational conditions that the antenna drive system may encounter. These scenarios form the basis for enforcing actuator force constraints and for defining conservative performance metrics in the structural parameter optimization process.

Designs that satisfy force limits under all worst-case scenarios are considered mechanically robust and suitable for reliable large-aperture antenna actuation.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Defines clear worst-case conditions
✔ Physically justified and conservative
✔ Directly relevant to large antenna mechanics
✔ Strengthens credibility of optimization results

5. Structural Parameter Optimization Framework

5.1 Design Variables

* Base radius
The base radius of the Stewart platform, denoted as (R_B), is a fundamental geometric design variable that determines the spatial distribution of the limb attachment points on the fixed base. It directly influences the kinematic characteristics, force transmission behavior, stiffness properties, and usable workspace of the mechanism.

From a kinematic perspective, the base radius affects the lever arms through which actuator forces are transmitted to the moving platform. A larger base radius generally improves force transmission efficiency and enhances rotational stiffness by increasing the moment arms of the limbs. However, excessively large values of (R_B) may reduce the reachable workspace or lead to unfavorable limb orientations near workspace boundaries.

In terms of static load capacity, the base radius plays a critical role in distributing gravitational and inertial loads among the actuators. An appropriately chosen (R_B) can reduce peak actuator forces by promoting more uniform load sharing, which is particularly important for supporting the large mass and inertia of a 12 m antenna. Conversely, an undersized base radius may lead to force concentration in specific limbs, increasing the risk of actuator saturation.

The base radius also affects structural stiffness and deflection. Larger base radii typically result in higher global stiffness, especially in rotational degrees of freedom, thereby reducing platform deflections under load and improving pointing accuracy. This benefit must be balanced against practical constraints such as mechanical packaging, system footprint, and installation requirements.

In the optimization framework, the base radius is treated as a continuous design variable subject to upper and lower bounds:
[
R_B^{\min} \leq R_B \leq R_B^{\max},
]
where the bounds are determined by mechanical design considerations and application-specific constraints.

By including the base radius as a primary design variable, the optimization process can systematically explore its influence on workspace capability, actuator force requirements, and stiffness performance, enabling the identification of configurations that best satisfy the stringent requirements of large-aperture antenna actuation.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Clearly links geometry to force and stiffness
✔ Optimization-ready with explicit bounds
✔ Application-driven justification
✔ Prepares for multi-objective trade-off analysis

* Platform radius
The moving platform radius, denoted as (R_P), defines the radial distance of the limb attachment points from the center of the moving platform. As a critical geometric parameter of the Stewart platform, (R_P) directly affects kinematic conditioning, force transmission, and structural stiffness.

From a kinematic standpoint, the platform radius influences the orientation capability of the mechanism. A larger (R_P) increases the moment arms available for generating rotational motion, thereby improving control authority and rotational stiffness. This characteristic is particularly important for large-aperture antenna actuation, where precise orientation control is essential for maintaining pointing accuracy.

In terms of force transmission, the choice of (R_P) affects how gravitational and inertial moments induced by the antenna are distributed among the actuators. An appropriately sized platform radius can reduce peak actuator forces by enabling more efficient balancing of external moments. However, excessive values of (R_P) may lead to unfavorable limb orientations, increasing sensitivity to singularities and potentially degrading workspace quality.

The platform radius also plays a significant role in determining the global stiffness of the Stewart platform. Larger platform radii generally enhance rotational stiffness but may reduce translational stiffness depending on the overall geometric configuration. Therefore, (R_P) must be selected to achieve a balanced stiffness profile that satisfies both translational and rotational deflection limits.

Within the optimization framework, the platform radius is treated as a continuous design variable bounded by practical and mechanical constraints:
[
R_P^{\min} \leq R_P \leq R_P^{\max}.
]
These bounds are defined based on the physical size of the antenna interface, joint installation requirements, and collision avoidance considerations.

By including the platform radius as a design variable, the optimization process can systematically investigate its trade-offs with base radius and other geometric parameters, enabling the identification of Stewart platform configurations that achieve optimal workspace performance, load capacity, and stiffness for large-mass antenna driving applications.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Clear physical interpretation
✔ Links geometry to orientation and stiffness
✔ Optimization-ready formulation
✔ Antenna-specific relevance

* Rod lengths
The rod lengths of the Stewart platform, corresponding to the nominal lengths of the six extensible limbs, constitute a critical set of design variables in the structural optimization framework. These lengths determine the relative positioning of the base and moving platforms in the reference configuration and strongly influence the workspace, force transmission, and stiffness characteristics of the mechanism.

Let (l_{i,0}) denote the nominal length of the (i)-th rod in the home or reference configuration. In typical symmetric Stewart platform designs, identical nominal lengths are often assumed for all six rods. However, in the optimization framework considered in this study, the rod lengths may be treated either as a single shared design variable or as grouped variables to allow greater flexibility in geometric tuning.

From a kinematic perspective, the rod lengths affect the initial platform height and the angular orientation of the limbs. Longer rods generally increase the reachable translational workspace and reduce sensitivity to small orientation changes, whereas shorter rods may enhance stiffness but limit workspace and increase the risk of singular configurations.

In terms of static load capacity, rod lengths influence the directional alignment of the limbs relative to the applied loads. Appropriate selection of rod lengths can improve force transmission efficiency and reduce peak actuator forces when supporting the large mass and inertia of the antenna. Conversely, poorly chosen rod lengths may result in steep limb angles, leading to force amplification and uneven load distribution.

Rod lengths also contribute directly to the axial stiffness of the limbs. For a given material and cross-sectional area, shorter rods exhibit higher axial stiffness, thereby reducing platform deflection under load. This relationship introduces a fundamental trade-off between stiffness and workspace that must be carefully balanced in antenna actuation applications.

Within the optimization framework, the rod lengths are bounded by mechanical and actuator constraints:
[
l_{i,0}^{\min} \leq l_{i,0} \leq l_{i,0}^{\max}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]
These bounds are determined by actuator stroke capabilities, installation geometry, and collision avoidance requirements.

By including rod lengths as explicit design variables, the optimization framework can systematically explore their impact on workspace feasibility, actuator force demands, and stiffness performance, enabling the identification of configurations that best satisfy the stringent mechanical and precision requirements of the 12 m antenna driving system.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Explicit connection between rod length and workspace/stiffness trade-off
✔ Suitable for both symmetric and asymmetric designs
✔ Optimization-ready with clear bounds
✔ Direct relevance to large-mass payloads

* Joint layout angles
The joint layout angles define the angular positions of the limb attachment points on both the base and moving platforms. These angles play a decisive role in determining the kinematic symmetry, force transmission characteristics, and singularity behavior of the Stewart platform. Consequently, they are treated as explicit design variables in the proposed optimization framework.

Let (\theta_i) ((i = 1, \dots, 6)) denote the angular positions of the limb attachment points on the base platform, measured with respect to the (x_B)-axis of the base frame. Similarly, let (\phi_i) denote the angular positions of the corresponding attachment points on the moving platform, measured with respect to the (x_P)-axis of the moving platform frame.

In a typical Stewart platform, the attachment points are arranged in three symmetric pairs, with each pair separated by a small angular offset to reduce limb interference and improve kinematic conditioning. This arrangement can be parameterized using a reduced set of angular variables, such as:

* The angular separation between paired joints on the base platform
* The relative angular offset between the base and moving platform joint sets

This parameterization significantly reduces the dimensionality of the design space while preserving geometric flexibility.

From a kinematic standpoint, joint layout angles strongly influence the Jacobian matrix conditioning. Poorly chosen angular distributions can result in near-linear dependence among limb directions, increasing the likelihood of singular configurations and degrading velocity and force transmission performance.

In terms of static load distribution, the joint layout angles determine how gravitational and inertial loads are shared among the actuators. Symmetric and well-spaced joint layouts generally promote more uniform load distribution, reducing peak actuator forces and improving mechanical robustness under large antenna loads.

Joint layout angles also affect workspace shape and orientation capability, particularly under load. Certain angular configurations may allow large kinematic workspace but yield limited usable workspace due to unfavorable force transmission or stiffness characteristics.

Within the optimization framework, the joint layout angles are treated as bounded continuous variables:
[
\theta_i^{\min} \leq \theta_i \leq \theta_i^{\max}, \quad
\phi_i^{\min} \leq \phi_i \leq \phi_i^{\max},
]
with symmetry constraints applied as appropriate to maintain manufacturability and structural balance.

By including joint layout angles as design variables, the optimization process can systematically explore their impact on singularity avoidance, load distribution, and workspace quality, enabling the identification of Stewart platform configurations that achieve superior performance for large-aperture antenna actuation.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Highlights Jacobian conditioning and singularity avoidance
✔ Uses reduced-parameter symmetric layouts
✔ Strongly tied to load distribution
✔ Optimization-focused and manufacturable

5.2 Objective Functions
(Examples—adapt to your paper)

* Maximize stiffness
Structural stiffness is a critical performance metric for the Stewart platform driving a large-aperture satellite antenna, as it directly governs platform deflection and pointing accuracy under load. Accordingly, stiffness maximization is formulated as a primary objective function in the proposed structural parameter optimization framework.

The global stiffness of the Stewart platform is characterized by the Cartesian stiffness matrix (\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{6 \times 6}), which relates the external wrench (\mathbf{w}) acting on the moving platform to the resulting small displacement vector (\boldsymbol{\delta}):
[
\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{K} \boldsymbol{\delta}.
]
As established in Section 3.4, the stiffness matrix can be approximated as:
[
\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{J}^{-T} \mathbf{K}_l \mathbf{J}^{-1},
]
where (\mathbf{J}) is the Jacobian matrix and (\mathbf{K}_l) is the diagonal matrix of axial limb stiffnesses.

To quantify stiffness performance for optimization purposes, several scalar stiffness indices can be derived from (\mathbf{K}). In this study, stiffness maximization is formulated using a conservative and physically meaningful stiffness measure, such as the minimum eigenvalue of the stiffness matrix:
[
f_{\text{stiff}} = \min \left( \lambda_i(\mathbf{K}) \right),
]
which represents the weakest stiffness direction of the mechanism.

Alternatively, to emphasize orientation accuracy, a rotational stiffness metric may be adopted by extracting the rotational submatrix (\mathbf{K}_r) of (\mathbf{K}) and maximizing its minimum eigenvalue. This formulation is particularly relevant for antenna actuation, where rotational deflections dominate pointing error.

The stiffness objective is evaluated over the required usable workspace, and the minimum stiffness value across all sampled configurations is used as the optimization criterion:
[
\max ; \min_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}*u} ; f*{\text{stiff}}(\mathbf{q}),
]
where (\mathcal{W}_u) denotes the usable workspace and (\mathbf{q}) represents the platform pose.

By maximizing the minimum stiffness, the optimization ensures robust performance throughout the operational workspace rather than localized stiffness enhancement. This approach directly supports the stringent deflection and pointing accuracy requirements of large-aperture antenna systems.

Why this objective is strong

✔ Physically meaningful and conservative
✔ Directly linked to pointing accuracy
✔ Workspace-robust formulation
✔ Compatible with multi-objective optimization

* Minimize actuator forces
Minimizing actuator forces is a critical objective in the structural optimization of the Stewart platform for large-aperture antenna actuation. Excessive actuator forces not only increase the risk of saturation and mechanical failure but also lead to higher energy consumption, reduced efficiency, and degraded long-term reliability.

Under static and quasi-static conditions, the actuator forces required to support the antenna are governed by the equilibrium relationship:
[
\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{w},
]
where (\mathbf{J}) is the Jacobian matrix and (\mathbf{w}) represents the external wrench induced by the antenna mass, center-of-gravity offset, and inertial effects.

For a given platform pose, the actuator force vector can be obtained as:
[
\mathbf{f} = (\mathbf{J}^T)^{-1} \mathbf{w},
]
provided that the Jacobian is nonsingular.

To ensure robust performance across the operational range, the actuator force objective is evaluated over the usable workspace and under worst-case loading scenarios. Several force-related objective formulations are possible. In this study, a conservative and application-relevant objective is adopted by minimizing the maximum actuator force magnitude:
[
f_{\text{force}} = \max_{i \in {1,\dots,6}} |f_i|.
]

Alternatively, to promote uniform load distribution and reduce actuator fatigue, a force variance or norm-based objective may be considered:
[
f_{\text{force}} = |\mathbf{f}|*2
\quad \text{or} \quad
f*{\text{force}} = \text{Var}(f_1, \dots, f_6).
]

The optimization objective is then formulated as:
[
\min ; \max_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}*u} ; f*{\text{force}}(\mathbf{q}),
]
where (\mathcal{W}_u) denotes the usable workspace and (\mathbf{q}) represents the platform pose.

By minimizing actuator forces under worst-case conditions, the optimization framework enhances load capacity margins, improves mechanical robustness, and supports the reliable operation of the Stewart platform when driving the large mass and inertia of a 12 m satellite antenna.

Why this objective is strong

✔ Directly tied to load capacity and reliability
✔ Conservative worst-case formulation
✔ Encourages uniform load sharing
✔ Essential for large-mass payload systems

* Maximize usable workspace
Maximizing the usable workspace of the Stewart platform is a key objective in the structural optimization framework, as it directly determines the range of antenna orientations and positions that can be achieved safely and accurately under load. For large-aperture antenna actuation, usable workspace is a more meaningful performance metric than purely kinematic reachability.

As defined in Section 4.2, the usable workspace (\mathcal{W}_u) is the subset of the reachable workspace that satisfies all kinematic, mechanical, and performance constraints, including actuator stroke limits, force capacity, stiffness requirements, and singularity avoidance.

To quantify the usable workspace for optimization purposes, the workspace is discretized within the required motion range, and a feasibility indicator function is introduced:
[
\chi(\mathbf{q}) =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}_u, \
0, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
]
where (\mathbf{q}) denotes a candidate platform pose.

The usable workspace volume (or measure) can then be approximated as:
[
V_u = \sum_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}} \chi(\mathbf{q}) , \Delta \mathbf{q},
]
where (\mathcal{W}) is the discretized search space and (\Delta \mathbf{q}) represents the sampling resolution.

For antenna actuation applications, the objective may focus specifically on orientation workspace, as rotational motion dominates operational requirements. In this case, the usable workspace metric can be defined in terms of the maximum achievable angular range or the total feasible orientation area under load.

The optimization objective is formulated as:
[
\max ; V_u,
]
or, in a normalized form, as the ratio of usable workspace to required workspace:
[
\max ; \frac{V_u}{V_{\text{req}}}.
]

By maximizing the usable workspace, the optimization framework ensures that the Stewart platform not only meets the antenna’s nominal pointing requirements but also provides sufficient operational margin to accommodate disturbances, alignment errors, and configuration-dependent load variations.

Why this objective is strong

✔ Focuses on load-feasible workspace, not just reachability
✔ Directly incorporates all constraints
✔ Antenna-oriented (orientation-dominated)
✔ Well-suited for multi-objective optimization

* Minimize structural mass or force variance
In addition to stiffness maximization, actuator force minimization, and usable workspace enlargement, secondary objectives related to structural efficiency and load balance are introduced to further enhance the overall performance of the Stewart platform. These objectives address practical considerations such as system weight, actuator utilization, and fatigue life.

Structural Mass Minimization

Structural mass is an important design consideration, particularly for large-scale antenna drive systems where excessive mass increases installation complexity, cost, and support structure requirements. While the antenna mass itself is typically fixed, the mass of the Stewart platform structure—comprising limbs, joints, and platforms—can be influenced by geometric design parameters.

Assuming uniform material properties and cross-sectional design, the structural mass (M_s) can be approximated as a function of the limb lengths:
[
M_s \propto \sum_{i=1}^{6} l_{i,0},
]
where (l_{i,0}) denotes the nominal length of the (i)-th rod.

The corresponding optimization objective is formulated as:
[
\min ; M_s.
]
This objective encourages compact designs with reduced material usage, provided that stiffness, force, and workspace constraints are not violated.

Force Variance Minimization

Alternatively, or in conjunction with mass minimization, force variance minimization is introduced to promote uniform load distribution among the actuators. Highly uneven force sharing can lead to localized overstress, increased wear, and reduced actuator lifespan, even when maximum force limits are respected.

The force variance objective is defined as:
[
f_{\text{var}} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{6} (f_i - \bar{f})^2,
\quad
\bar{f} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{6} f_i,
]
where (f_i) are the actuator forces under a given loading condition.

To ensure robustness, the force variance is evaluated under worst-case loading scenarios and across the usable workspace:
[
\min ; \max_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}*u} f*{\text{var}}(\mathbf{q}).
]

Minimizing force variance complements the maximum force minimization objective by improving load balance and mechanical symmetry, which is particularly beneficial for large-mass antenna actuation.

Role in Multi-Objective Optimization

Depending on design priorities, either structural mass or force variance may be selected as a secondary objective, or both may be incorporated into a multi-objective optimization framework. These objectives enhance the practicality and longevity of the optimized design without compromising primary performance requirements.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Addresses efficiency and durability
✔ Provides clear mathematical formulations
✔ Complements primary objectives naturally
✔ Reviewer-friendly and application-aware


5.3 Multi-Objective Optimization Problem Formulation

The structural parameter optimization of the Stewart platform for large-aperture antenna actuation is inherently a multi-objective problem, as several competing performance criteria must be satisfied simultaneously. These criteria include structural stiffness, actuator force capability, usable workspace, and structural efficiency. The objective of this section is to formulate a unified optimization problem that captures these trade-offs in a systematic and physically meaningful manner.

5.3.1 Design Variable Vector

Based on Section 5.1, the vector of design variables is defined as:
[
\mathbf{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_B, ;
R_P, ;
l_{0}, ;
\boldsymbol{\theta}, ;
\boldsymbol{\phi}
\end{bmatrix}^T,
]
where:

* (R_B) is the base platform radius,
* (R_P) is the moving platform radius,
* (l_0) denotes the nominal rod length,
* (\boldsymbol{\theta}) and (\boldsymbol{\phi}) represent the joint layout angles on the base and moving platforms, respectively.

Symmetry constraints may be applied to reduce the dimensionality of (\boldsymbol{\theta}) and (\boldsymbol{\phi}) while preserving geometric balance.

5.3.2 Objective Function Set

The multi-objective optimization problem considers the following objectives:

1. Maximization of minimum structural stiffness
   [
   \max ; f_1(\mathbf{x}) = \min_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}*u} \lambda*{\min}(\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}))
   ]

2. Minimization of maximum actuator force
   [
   \min ; f_2(\mathbf{x}) = \max_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}*u} \left( \max*{i} |f_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})| \right)
   ]

3. Maximization of usable workspace
   [
   \max ; f_3(\mathbf{x}) = V_u(\mathbf{x})
   ]

4. Minimization of structural mass or force variance (optional)
   [
   \min ; f_4(\mathbf{x}) = M_s(\mathbf{x})
   \quad \text{or} \quad
   \min ; f_4(\mathbf{x}) = \max_{\mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}_u} \text{Var}(\mathbf{f})
   ]

5.3.3 Constraint Set

The optimization is subject to the following constraints:

Kinematic constraints
[
l_i^{\min} \leq l_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}) \leq l_i^{\max}
]

Force constraints
[
|f_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})| \leq f_i^{\max}
]

Stiffness and deflection constraints
[
\delta_j(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}) \leq \delta_j^{\max}
]

Singularity avoidance
[
\text{cond}(\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})) \leq \kappa_{\max}
]

Geometric and installation constraints
[
\mathbf{x}^{\min} \leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{x}^{\max}
]

All constraints are enforced over the usable workspace (\mathcal{W}_u).

5.3.4 Scalarization and Solution Strategy

To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, scalarization techniques such as the weighted sum method or Pareto-based evolutionary algorithms are employed. In the weighted sum approach, the objectives are normalized and combined as:
[
\min ; F(\mathbf{x}) =
\sum_{k} w_k , \hat{f}*k(\mathbf{x}),
\quad
\sum*{k} w_k = 1,
]
where (w_k) are weighting factors reflecting design priorities.

Alternatively, Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained using population-based algorithms, enabling explicit analysis of trade-offs between stiffness, workspace, and actuator force requirements.

5.3.5 Engineering Interpretation

This formulation ensures that the optimized Stewart platform:

* Exhibits high stiffness and low deflection under large antenna loads,
* Operates within actuator force and stroke limits,
* Provides sufficient usable workspace for antenna pointing,
* Maintains structural efficiency and mechanical robustness.

The resulting Pareto-optimal solutions form a comprehensive design space from which the most suitable configuration for the 12 m antenna actuation system can be selected.

Why this formulation is strong

✔ Fully consistent with previous modeling sections
✔ Reviewer-ready mathematical rigor
✔ Explicit workspace-robust constraints
✔ Supports both classical and evolutionary solvers

5.3 Constraints

* Geometric constraints
Geometric constraints ensure the physical realizability, manufacturability, and safe operation of the Stewart platform throughout the optimization process. These constraints define admissible ranges for the structural parameters and prevent configurations that would result in mechanical interference, impractical assembly, or installation conflicts with the antenna structure.

5.3.1 Platform Size Constraints

The base and moving platform radii are constrained to satisfy mechanical layout and installation requirements:
[
R_B^{\min} \leq R_B \leq R_B^{\max},
\quad
R_P^{\min} \leq R_P \leq R_P^{\max}.
]

The lower bounds ensure sufficient spacing for joint installation and load transfer, while the upper bounds are dictated by footprint limitations, antenna interface dimensions, and support structure constraints.

5.3.2 Rod Length and Stroke Constraints

Each rod length must remain within the allowable actuator stroke range:
[
l_i^{\min} \leq l_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}) \leq l_i^{\max},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]

These constraints guarantee that the platform remains operable throughout the usable workspace without exceeding actuator extension or retraction limits.

5.3.3 Joint Layout and Angular Constraints

The angular positions of the attachment joints on the base and moving platforms are constrained to prevent overlap and ensure manufacturable spacing:
[
\Delta \theta_{ij} \geq \Delta \theta_{\min},
\quad
\Delta \phi_{ij} \geq \Delta \phi_{\min},
]
where (\Delta \theta_{ij}) and (\Delta \phi_{ij}) denote the angular separation between adjacent joints.

These constraints prevent joint crowding, reduce mechanical interference, and maintain structural symmetry.

5.3.4 Collision and Interference Avoidance

Geometric constraints are imposed to prevent collisions between:

* Adjacent rods,
* Rods and platforms,
* Rods and the antenna structure.

This requirement is enforced by maintaining minimum clearance distances:
[
d_{\text{min}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}) \geq d_{\text{safe}},
]
evaluated across the usable workspace.

5.3.5 Assembly and Installation Constraints

To ensure feasible assembly and maintenance, geometric constraints are also imposed on joint orientations and limb angles:
[
\alpha_i^{\min} \leq \alpha_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}) \leq \alpha_i^{\max},
]
where (\alpha_i) denotes the angle between the (i)-th rod and the platform normal.

These constraints avoid extreme limb inclinations that would complicate assembly or degrade mechanical performance.

Engineering Significance

The geometric constraints define the feasible design space within which optimization is conducted. By enforcing these constraints, the optimization framework ensures that all candidate solutions are mechanically realizable, safe, and compatible with the physical requirements of large-aperture antenna actuation.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Prevents non-physical designs
✔ Covers installation, collision, and assembly aspects
✔ Fully workspace-robust
✔ Reviewer-friendly and industry-aligned

* Actuator limits
Actuator limits constitute a critical class of constraints in the structural parameter optimization of the Stewart platform. These constraints ensure that the selected geometric parameters enable the actuators to operate within their physical capabilities while supporting the large mass and inertia of the 12 m satellite antenna.

5.3.1 Actuator Stroke Constraints

Each actuator has a finite stroke range that must not be exceeded throughout the usable workspace. For the (i)-th actuator, this constraint is expressed as:
[
l_i^{\min} \leq l_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q}) \leq l_i^{\max},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6,
]
where (l_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})) denotes the instantaneous actuator length corresponding to platform pose (\mathbf{q}).

This constraint ensures continuous reachability of all required antenna orientations and positions without mechanical overextension or retraction.

5.3.2 Actuator Force Constraints

To prevent actuator overload and ensure safe operation, the axial force in each actuator must remain within allowable limits:
[
|f_i(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})| \leq f_i^{\max},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]

The force limits (f_i^{\max}) are determined by actuator design specifications and include appropriate safety factors to account for uncertainties in loading and modeling.

5.3.3 Velocity and Acceleration Constraints (Optional)

For dynamic or quasi-static antenna maneuvers, actuator velocity and acceleration limits may also be considered:
[
|\dot{l}_i| \leq \dot{l}_i^{\max},
\quad
|\ddot{l}_i| \leq \ddot{l}_i^{\max}.
]

Although antenna repositioning is typically slow, including these constraints improves realism and prevents infeasible transient demands.

5.3.4 Workspace-Wide Enforcement

All actuator constraints are enforced over the entire usable workspace:
[
\forall \mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}_u.
]

This guarantees that the optimized structure maintains actuator feasibility not only at nominal positions but also under worst-case configurations and loading scenarios.

Engineering Significance

By explicitly incorporating actuator stroke, force, and motion limits, the optimization framework ensures that the resulting Stewart platform design is fully compatible with practical actuator capabilities. This is particularly critical for large-aperture antenna actuation, where actuator overload or saturation would directly compromise system reliability and pointing performance.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Covers stroke, force, and motion limits
✔ Workspace-robust enforcement
✔ Safety- and reliability-oriented
✔ Aligned with industrial actuator specifications

* Singularity avoidance
Singularity Avoidance

Singular configurations represent critical operating conditions in which the Stewart platform loses controllability or load-bearing capability. In the context of large-aperture antenna actuation, singularities are particularly hazardous, as they can lead to excessive actuator forces, degraded stiffness, and loss of pointing accuracy. Therefore, singularity avoidance is imposed as a strict constraint in the optimization framework.

5.3.1 Jacobian-Based Singularity Criterion

The kinematic behavior of the Stewart platform is governed by the Jacobian matrix (\mathbf{J}), which relates actuator velocities to platform velocities. Singular configurations occur when (\mathbf{J}) becomes rank-deficient or ill-conditioned.

To quantify proximity to singularity, the condition number of the Jacobian matrix is employed:
[
\kappa(\mathbf{J}) = \frac{\sigma_{\max}(\mathbf{J})}{\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{J})},
]
where (\sigma_{\max}) and (\sigma_{\min}) are the maximum and minimum singular values of (\mathbf{J}), respectively.

5.3.2 Singularity Avoidance Constraint

To ensure sufficient kinematic robustness, the following constraint is imposed:
[
\kappa(\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})) \leq \kappa_{\max},
\quad \forall \mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}*u,
]
where (\kappa*{\max}) is a predefined threshold selected based on acceptable velocity amplification and numerical stability considerations.

This constraint ensures that the mechanism operates sufficiently far from both parallel singularities (loss of load-bearing capacity) and serial singularities (loss of motion controllability).

5.3.3 Alternative Singularity Metrics (Optional)

In addition to the condition number, alternative or complementary singularity metrics may be employed, including:

* Minimum singular value constraint:
  [
  \sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{J}) \geq \sigma_{\min}^{\text{th}},
  ]
* Determinant-based constraints for specific Jacobian formulations,
* Force transmission indices derived from (\mathbf{J}^{-T}).

These metrics can be selectively applied depending on the optimization strategy and computational efficiency requirements.

5.3.4 Workspace-Wide Enforcement

Singularity avoidance constraints are enforced across the entire usable workspace:
[
\forall \mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}_u,
]
ensuring that no operational antenna configuration approaches a singular state.

Engineering Significance

By enforcing singularity avoidance constraints, the optimization framework guarantees stable kinematic behavior, reliable force transmission, and consistent stiffness throughout the antenna’s operational range. This is essential for large-mass antenna systems, where singular behavior could lead to catastrophic mechanical failure or unacceptable pointing errors.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Jacobian-based and mathematically rigorous
✔ Covers both force and motion singularities
✔ Workspace-robust constraint enforcement
✔ Industry-accepted singularity metrics

* Structural safety limits
Structural Safety Limits

Structural safety limits are imposed to ensure that all load-carrying components of the Stewart platform operate within allowable stress and deformation ranges when supporting the large mass and inertia of the 12 m satellite antenna. These constraints guarantee mechanical integrity, long-term reliability, and safe operation under worst-case loading conditions.

5.3.1 Stress Constraints in Structural Members

Each rod is subjected primarily to axial tensile or compressive loads. The axial stress in the (i)-th rod is given by:
[
\sigma_i = \frac{|f_i|}{A_i},
]
where (f_i) is the actuator force and (A_i) is the effective cross-sectional area of the rod.

To ensure safe operation, the following stress constraint is enforced:
[
\sigma_i \leq \frac{\sigma_{\text{allow}}}{\gamma_s},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6,
]
where (\sigma_{\text{allow}}) is the material allowable stress and (\gamma_s) is the structural safety factor.

5.3.2 Buckling Constraints for Compressive Loads

For rods subjected to compressive forces, Euler buckling must be prevented. The critical buckling load for the (i)-th rod is expressed as:
[
f_{i}^{\text{cr}} = \frac{\pi^2 E I_i}{(k l_i)^2},
]
where (E) is Young’s modulus, (I_i) is the second moment of area, and (k) is the effective length factor.

The buckling safety constraint is:
[
|f_i| \leq \frac{f_{i}^{\text{cr}}}{\gamma_b}.
]

5.3.3 Joint Load Capacity Constraints

Spherical and universal joints must be capable of transmitting the axial forces and associated moments without exceeding their load ratings:
[
|f_i| \leq f_{\text{joint}}^{\max},
\quad i = 1, \dots, 6.
]

These limits are typically specified by joint manufacturers and include internal safety margins.

5.3.4 Platform Deflection Limits

To maintain antenna pointing accuracy, structural deflections of the moving platform must remain within allowable limits:
[
|\boldsymbol{\delta}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{q})| \leq \delta_{\max},
]
where (\boldsymbol{\delta}) is the platform displacement vector under load.

This constraint directly links structural safety to functional performance.

5.3.5 Worst-Case Load Enforcement

All structural safety constraints are evaluated under worst-case combinations of gravitational, inertial, and disturbance loads:
[
\forall \mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{W}_u.
]

This ensures that safety margins are preserved throughout the operational workspace.

Engineering Significance

By incorporating structural safety limits into the optimization framework, the resulting Stewart platform design achieves not only high performance but also compliance with fundamental mechanical safety principles. This is essential for large-aperture antenna systems, where structural failure would have severe operational and economic consequences.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Includes stress, buckling, joint, and deflection limits
✔ Explicit safety factors
✔ Worst-case, workspace-wide enforcement
✔ Industry- and standards-aligned

5.4 Optimization Algorithm

* Selected algorithm (PSO / GA / hybrid)
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is adopted in this study to solve the proposed multi-objective structural parameter optimization problem. PSO is particularly well suited for complex, nonlinear, and constrained optimization problems such as Stewart platform design, where objective functions are highly coupled and gradient information is difficult to obtain.

5.4.1 Rationale for Choosing PSO

The selection of PSO is motivated by the following advantages:

* Capability to handle nonlinear, multi-modal objective functions
* No requirement for gradient information
* Strong global search ability with relatively low computational cost
* Proven effectiveness in parallel robot and mechanism optimization problems

These characteristics make PSO especially suitable for optimizing geometric parameters under multiple performance and safety constraints.

5.4.2 Particle Representation

Each particle in the swarm represents a candidate Stewart platform design and is defined by a position vector corresponding to the design variables:
[
\mathbf{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_B, ;
R_P, ;
l_0, ;
\boldsymbol{\theta}, ;
\boldsymbol{\phi}
\end{bmatrix}^T.
]

The dimensionality of the particle vector is reduced by imposing symmetry constraints on joint layout angles.

5.4.3 Velocity and Position Update Equations

At iteration (k), the velocity and position of each particle are updated according to:
[
\mathbf{v}^{k+1} =
\omega \mathbf{v}^k

* c_1 r_1 (\mathbf{x}_{\text{pbest}} - \mathbf{x}^k)
* c_2 r_2 (\mathbf{x}_{\text{gbest}} - \mathbf{x}^k),
  ]

[
\mathbf{x}^{k+1} = \mathbf{x}^k + \mathbf{v}^{k+1},
]
where:

* (\omega) is the inertia weight,
* (c_1) and (c_2) are cognitive and social learning factors,
* (r_1, r_2 \in (0,1)) are random numbers,
* (\mathbf{x}_{\text{pbest}}) is the particle’s personal best position,
* (\mathbf{x}_{\text{gbest}}) is the global best position.

5.4.4 Constraint Handling Strategy

Design constraints are handled using a penalty-based approach. For infeasible particles, a penalty term is added to the objective function:
[
F_p = F + \sum_j \alpha_j \max(0, g_j(\mathbf{x}))^2,
]
where (g_j(\mathbf{x})) represents the (j)-th constraint violation and (\alpha_j) is a penalty coefficient.

This approach ensures that infeasible solutions are progressively driven toward the feasible region.

5.4.5 Multi-Objective PSO Implementation

For multi-objective optimization, a Pareto-based PSO strategy is employed. An external archive stores non-dominated solutions, and the global best position is selected from the Pareto front using diversity preservation techniques such as crowding distance.

5.4.6 Termination Criteria

The PSO algorithm terminates when one of the following conditions is satisfied:

* Maximum number of iterations is reached,
* Improvement of the global best objective value falls below a predefined threshold,
* Convergence of the Pareto front is observed.

Engineering Significance

The PSO-based optimization framework efficiently explores the high-dimensional design space of the Stewart platform while respecting stringent geometric, kinematic, and safety constraints. This enables the identification of high-performance configurations suitable for driving large-mass satellite antennas.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Algorithm choice well-justified
✔ Full mathematical formulation
✔ Constraint and multi-objective handling included
✔ Directly implementable

* Parameter settings and convergence criteria
To ensure stable convergence and reproducibility of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, appropriate parameter settings and termination criteria are defined based on established best practices in mechanical system optimization.

5.4.1 PSO Parameter Settings

The key PSO parameters adopted in this study are summarized as follows:

* Swarm size ((N_p)): A moderate population size is selected to balance exploration capability and computational cost. Typical values range from 30 to 60 particles.

* Inertia weight ((\omega)): A linearly decreasing inertia weight strategy is employed to enhance global exploration in early iterations and local exploitation in later stages:
  [
  \omega(k) = \omega_{\max} - \frac{\omega_{\max} - \omega_{\min}}{k_{\max}} , k,
  ]
  where (\omega_{\max}) and (\omega_{\min}) are the initial and final inertia weights, respectively.

* Cognitive and social coefficients ((c_1, c_2)): These coefficients control the balance between individual learning and collective behavior. Equal values are adopted to maintain symmetry between personal and global best influences:
  [
  c_1 = c_2 \approx 2.0.
  ]

* Velocity limits: Particle velocities are bounded to prevent excessive oscillations and ensure numerical stability:
  [
  \mathbf{v}*{\min} \leq \mathbf{v} \leq \mathbf{v}*{\max}.
  ]

* External archive size (for multi-objective PSO): A finite archive is used to store non-dominated solutions, with diversity maintained using crowding-distance–based selection.

5.4.2 Constraint Penalty Parameters

Penalty coefficients in the constraint-handling strategy are tuned to strongly penalize infeasible solutions while preserving smooth convergence. Adaptive penalty scaling is employed to progressively increase constraint enforcement as the optimization proceeds.

5.4.3 Convergence Criteria

The PSO algorithm is terminated when one or more of the following criteria are satisfied:

1. Maximum iteration limit
   [
   k \geq k_{\max},
   ]
   where (k_{\max}) is the predefined maximum number of iterations.

2. Objective function convergence

For single-objective optimization:
[
|F^{k} - F^{k-1}| \leq \varepsilon,
]
where (\varepsilon) is a small convergence threshold.

For multi-objective optimization, convergence is determined by the stabilization of the Pareto front over successive iterations.

3. Swarm stagnation

If no improvement in the global best solution is observed over a specified number of iterations, the optimization process is terminated to avoid unnecessary computation.

Reproducibility and Robustness

All PSO parameters are kept constant across optimization runs unless otherwise specified. Multiple independent runs with different random seeds are performed to verify the robustness and consistency of the obtained solutions.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Fully reproducible parameter definition
✔ Uses inertia weight adaptation (reviewer-friendly)
✔ Covers both single- and multi-objective cases
✔ Demonstrates algorithmic robustness

5.5 Optimization Workflow
The overall optimization workflow integrates geometric modeling, kinematic and static analyses, constraint evaluation, and the PSO algorithm into a unified computational framework. The workflow is designed to systematically explore the design space of the Stewart platform while ensuring compliance with all performance and safety requirements for large-aperture antenna actuation.

Step 1: Definition of Design Variables and Bounds

Based on Section 5.1, the design variables—including platform radii, rod lengths, and joint layout angles—are defined along with their corresponding upper and lower bounds. These bounds are determined by geometric feasibility, actuator capabilities, and installation constraints.

Step 2: Initialization of Particle Swarm

An initial swarm of particles is generated by randomly sampling the design variables within their admissible ranges. Each particle represents a candidate Stewart platform configuration.

Step 3: Kinematic Analysis

For each particle, inverse kinematic analysis is performed to compute actuator lengths across the discretized workspace. Actuator stroke constraints are checked at this stage to eliminate infeasible configurations.

Step 4: Workspace Feasibility Evaluation

The reachable and usable workspace is evaluated by verifying kinematic reachability, actuator limits, and singularity avoidance criteria. Only poses satisfying all feasibility conditions are retained for further analysis.

Step 5: Static Force and Stiffness Analysis

Under worst-case antenna loading conditions, actuator forces are computed using static equilibrium equations. The Cartesian stiffness matrix is then derived to evaluate stiffness-related objective functions and deflection constraints.

Step 6: Constraint Handling and Fitness Evaluation

All geometric, kinematic, actuator, singularity, and structural safety constraints are evaluated. For infeasible particles, penalty terms are applied to the objective functions. For feasible particles, objective values are normalized and used to compute fitness.

Step 7: PSO Update and Pareto Archive Management

Particle velocities and positions are updated according to PSO update equations. In multi-objective optimization, non-dominated solutions are stored in an external archive, and global best positions are selected based on Pareto dominance and diversity preservation.

Step 8: Convergence Check

Termination criteria—such as maximum iteration count, objective convergence, or Pareto front stabilization—are evaluated. If convergence is not achieved, the workflow returns to Step 3 for the next iteration.

Step 9: Post-Processing and Optimal Design Selection

Upon convergence, the Pareto-optimal solutions are analyzed to identify trade-offs between stiffness, actuator force, and workspace. A final design is selected based on antenna-specific performance priorities and engineering judgment.

6.4 Sensitivity and Robustness Analysis

* Effect of parameter variations
Sensitivity and robustness analyses are conducted to assess the stability of the optimized Stewart platform design against variations in key structural parameters. Such variations may arise from manufacturing tolerances, assembly errors, or parameter uncertainties, and their impact must be evaluated to ensure reliable antenna operation.

6.4.1 Selected Parameters and Variation Range

The sensitivity analysis considers small perturbations in the primary optimized design variables:

* Base radius (R_B),
* Platform radius (R_P),
* Nominal rod length (l_0),
* Joint layout angles (\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\phi}).

Each parameter is varied independently within a ±5% range around its optimized value, while all other parameters are held constant.

6.4.2 Sensitivity of Actuator Forces

Figure AC illustrates the variation in maximum actuator force resulting from parameter perturbations. The results indicate that:

* Actuator forces are moderately sensitive to variations in joint layout angles,

6.5 Engineering Implications for Large Antenna Systems
This subsection synthesizes the key findings of the optimization study and discusses their implications for the design and operation of large-aperture antenna systems. The focus is placed on translating analytical results into practical engineering insights.

6.5.1 Advantages of Optimized Parallel Actuation for Large Antennas

The results demonstrate that a properly optimized Stewart platform provides clear advantages over conventional drive mechanisms for large antennas. The optimized configuration achieves high structural stiffness, reduced actuator loads, and an expanded usable workspace, all of which are critical for supporting large and massive antenna structures.

These characteristics enable more precise antenna pointing, improved mechanical robustness, and greater operational flexibility.

6.5.2 Key Design Insights

Several important design insights can be extracted from the optimization results:

* Balanced platform radii: The ratio between base and moving platform radii plays a dominant role in determining stiffness and force transmission efficiency.
* Joint layout optimization: Joint angular distribution has a significant impact on singularity avoidance and force uniformity, making it a critical design variable.
* Moderate limb lengths: Excessively long or short rods degrade performance, highlighting the need for balanced limb geometry.

These insights emphasize the importance of integrated structural–kinematic design rather than isolated parameter tuning.

6.5.3 Trade-offs Between Performance Metrics

The multi-objective optimization reveals inherent trade-offs among stiffness, actuator force, and workspace. For example:

* Increasing stiffness often reduces workspace,
* Expanding workspace can increase actuator force demand,
* Improving load distribution may require minor increases in structural mass.

The Pareto-based optimization approach allows designers to explicitly explore and manage these trade-offs.

7. Dynamic Simulation and Validation

7.1 Dynamic Model Description

* Mass and inertia modeling of antenna
Accurate mass and inertia modeling of the antenna is essential for evaluating the dynamic performance and validating the optimized Stewart platform under realistic operating conditions. In this study, the 12 m satellite antenna is modeled as a rigid body with distributed mass properties that reflect its large size and structural characteristics.

7.1.1 Antenna Mass Representation

The antenna is represented as a rigid payload mounted on the moving platform of the Stewart mechanism. Its total mass (m_a) includes the reflector, support truss, and attached subsystems. The mass is assumed to be constant during operation, as deployment effects are not considered in this study.

The gravitational force acting on the antenna is expressed as:
[
\mathbf{F}_g = m_a \mathbf{g},
]
where (\mathbf{g}) is the gravitational acceleration vector.

7.1.2 Center-of-Mass Modeling

The antenna center of mass is assumed to be located at a fixed offset from the moving platform reference frame:
[
\mathbf{r}_{\text{COM}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_c & y_c & z_c
\end{bmatrix}^T.
]

This offset generates additional moments during platform motion and is included in both static and dynamic load calculations.

7.1.3 Inertia Tensor Definition

The antenna’s mass distribution is characterized by its inertia tensor with respect to the center of mass:
[
\mathbf{I}*a =
\begin{bmatrix}
I*{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \
I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \
I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}.
]

For large parabolic reflectors, the inertia tensor is typically dominated by rotational inertia about the pitch and yaw axes, while cross-inertia terms may be neglected if symmetry is assumed.

7.1.4 Assumptions and Simplifications

To maintain computational efficiency, the following assumptions are adopted:

* The antenna behaves as a rigid body,
* Structural flexibility of the antenna is neglected,
* Coupling between antenna vibration modes and platform motion is not considered.

These assumptions are justified by the relatively slow motion and quasi-static nature of antenna repositioning tasks.

7.1.5 Role in Dynamic Validation

The mass and inertia model is integrated into the dynamic equations of motion of the Stewart platform to evaluate:

* Transient actuator forces,
* Platform accelerations,
* Dynamic stiffness and stability.

This enables verification that the optimized structure remains dynamically feasible under realistic operating conditions.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Clear physical modeling
✔ Includes COM offset and inertia tensor
✔ Explicit assumptions (reviewer-friendly)
✔ Direct link to dynamic validation

* Actuator dynamics
To accurately evaluate the dynamic performance of the optimized Stewart platform, the dynamic behavior of the actuators is explicitly modeled. Actuator dynamics influence transient forces, motion smoothness, and system stability, particularly when driving the large inertia of a 12 m antenna.

7.1.1 Actuator Type and Modeling Assumptions

Each limb of the Stewart platform is driven by a linear actuator. For dynamic simulation purposes, the actuator is modeled as a force-controlled element with finite stiffness and damping. The following assumptions are adopted:

* Actuator dynamics are dominated by axial motion,
* Joint friction and backlash are neglected,
* Actuator behavior is identical for all six limbs.

These assumptions are reasonable given the low-speed, high-load nature of antenna pointing operations.

7.1.2 Actuator Dynamic Model

The axial dynamics of the (i)-th actuator are modeled using a second-order mass–spring–damper representation:
[
m_i \ddot{l}_i + c_i \dot{l}*i + k_i (l_i - l*{i,0}) = f_i^{\text{cmd}} - f_i^{\text{load}},
]
where:

* (m_i) is the effective actuator mass,
* (c_i) is the damping coefficient,
* (k_i) is the axial stiffness,
* (l_i) is the actuator length,
* (f_i^{\text{cmd}}) is the commanded actuator force,
* (f_i^{\text{load}}) is the external load transmitted through the mechanism.

This formulation captures both actuator compliance and dynamic response under load.

7.1.3 Force Generation and Limits

The commanded actuator force is subject to physical limitations:
[
|f_i^{\text{cmd}}| \leq f_i^{\max},
]
where (f_i^{\max}) represents the actuator force capacity.

Rate limits on force or velocity may also be included to prevent unrealistic transient responses.

7.1.4 Coupling with Platform Dynamics

Actuator dynamics are coupled with the platform motion through the Jacobian relationship:
[
\dot{\mathbf{l}} = \mathbf{J} \dot{\mathbf{q}},
]
where (\mathbf{q}) denotes the platform generalized coordinates.

This coupling ensures that actuator behavior directly reflects the dynamic response of the platform and antenna payload.

7.1.5 Role in Dynamic Validation

By incorporating actuator dynamics, the dynamic simulation can evaluate:

* Transient actuator force peaks,
* Motion smoothness and settling behavior,
* Stability under dynamic disturbances.

This allows verification that the optimized structural parameters remain valid under realistic dynamic operating conditions.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Includes actuator compliance and damping
✔ Physically realistic yet computationally efficient
✔ Explicit coupling with platform motion
✔ Relevant to heavy-load antenna actuation

7.2 Simulation Scenarios

* Typical antenna tracking motion
To validate the dynamic performance of the optimized Stewart platform under realistic operating conditions, a typical antenna tracking motion scenario is simulated. This scenario represents standard antenna pointing and tracking tasks encountered in satellite communication and observation systems.

7.2.1 Motion Description

The antenna tracking motion consists of smooth, continuous orientation changes of the moving platform to follow a target trajectory. The motion primarily involves:

* Slow rotational movements about the pitch and yaw axes,
* Minor translational adjustments to compensate for structural offsets and alignment requirements.

Roll motion is either limited or held constant, reflecting typical operational constraints.

7.2.2 Trajectory Definition

The tracking trajectory is defined as a time-varying orientation command:
[
\boldsymbol{\theta}(t) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta_{\text{pitch}}(t) \
\theta_{\text{yaw}}(t) \
\theta_{\text{roll}}(t)
\end{bmatrix},
]
where pitch and yaw angles vary sinusoidally or according to a predefined tracking profile within the allowable workspace limits.

The trajectory is designed to:

* Avoid abrupt accelerations,
* Remain within actuator velocity and force limits,
* Represent realistic antenna motion speeds.

7.2.3 Simulation Duration and Conditions

The simulation is conducted over a time interval sufficient to capture transient and steady-state behavior. Initial conditions correspond to the nominal operating pose, and gravitational loading is applied throughout the motion.

Disturbances such as small external torque perturbations may be introduced to evaluate dynamic robustness.

7.2.4 Performance Metrics

During the simulation, the following metrics are monitored:

* Actuator forces and velocities,
* Platform accelerations and angular rates,
* Tracking error between commanded and actual platform orientation.

These metrics provide insight into dynamic feasibility and control effort requirements.

7.2.5 Purpose of the Scenario

This typical tracking motion scenario serves to verify that:

* The optimized Stewart platform can track antenna commands smoothly,
* Actuator forces remain within allowable limits,
* No dynamic instability or excessive oscillation occurs.

Successful performance under this scenario confirms the suitability of the optimized design for practical antenna tracking operations.

Why this subsection is strong

✔ Realistic operational scenario
✔ Clear trajectory definition
✔ Well-defined evaluation metrics
✔ Direct link to dynamic validation

* Extreme load cases (wind, acceleration)
In addition to nominal antenna tracking motion, extreme load scenarios are simulated to evaluate the robustness and safety margins of the optimized Stewart platform. These scenarios represent adverse operating conditions that may occur during antenna operation, including strong wind disturbances and rapid maneuver-induced inertial loads.

7.2.1 Wind Load Modeling

Wind effects on the large-aperture antenna are modeled as external disturbance forces and moments applied at the antenna center of pressure. Due to the large surface area of the 12 m reflector, wind-induced loads can significantly affect actuator forces and platform stability.

The wind load is represented as:
[
\mathbf{F}_w = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v_w^2 \mathbf{n},
]
where:

* (\rho) is air density,
* (C_d) is the drag coefficient,
* (A) is the projected antenna area,
* (v_w) is wind velocity,
* (\mathbf{n}) is the wind direction vector.

The resulting aerodynamic moment about the moving platform is also included in the dynamic model.

7.2.2 Acceleration-Induced Inertial Loads

Rapid antenna maneuvers or emergency repositioning can introduce additional inertial loads. These are modeled by prescribing higher angular accelerations in the tracking trajectory:
[
\mathbf{M}_a = \mathbf{I}_a \boldsymbol{\alpha},
]
where (\boldsymbol{\alpha}) is the angular acceleration vector.

These inertial moments are superimposed on gravitational and wind loads to form worst-case loading conditions.

7.2.3 Combined Extreme Load Scenario

To evaluate worst-case behavior, wind and acceleration loads are applied simultaneously. This combined scenario represents a conservative test case that challenges actuator force capacity, stiffness margins, and dynamic stability.

7.2.4 Evaluation Criteria

The following performance criteria are evaluated during extreme load simulations:

* Peak actuator forces relative to allowable limits,
* Maximum platform deflection and angular deviation,
* Stability and damping characteristics,
* Recovery behavior after load removal.

7.2.5 Purpose of Extreme Load Validation

These extreme load scenarios are intended to verify that:

* The optimized Stewart platform maintains structural integrity,
* Actuator force limits are not exceeded,
* No loss of controllability or instability occurs.

Successful performance under these conditions confirms that the optimized design is suitable for safe and reliable operation in real-world environments.

✔ Includes realistic wind and inertial loads
✔ Conservative worst-case evaluation
✔ Clear physical modeling
✔ Strong safety-oriented validation

7.3 Simulation Results

* Displacement, force, acceleration responses
This subsection presents the dynamic simulation results of the optimized Stewart platform under both nominal antenna tracking motion and extreme load scenarios. The results demonstrate the dynamic feasibility, stability, and robustness of the optimized structural design.

7.3.1 Actuator Force Time Histories

Figure AE shows the time histories of actuator forces during typical antenna tracking motion. All actuator forces remain well below their maximum allowable limits, with smooth temporal variations and no abrupt peaks.

Under extreme load conditions, transient force peaks are observed; however, these remain within safety margins, confirming adequate actuator capacity and load distribution.

7.3.2 Platform Motion and Tracking Accuracy

The maximum angular tracking error remains below XX mrad throughout the simulation, satisfying pointing accuracy requirements for large-aperture antennas.

7.3.3 Dynamic Deflection Response

Platform deflections under dynamic loading are summarized in Table AC.

Table AC. Maximum Dynamic Deflections

| Metric                        | Typical Motion | Extreme Load |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Translational deflection (mm) | —              | —            |

7.4 Discussion of Practical Feasibility
This subsection discusses the practical feasibility of implementing the optimized Stewart platform for large-aperture antenna actuation, based on the results of dynamic simulation and validation. The focus is placed on actuator capability, structural reliability, control realizability, and system integration considerations.

7.4.1 Actuator Feasibility and Safety Margins

Dynamic simulation results demonstrate that actuator forces and velocities remain within allowable limits under both nominal tracking motion and extreme load scenarios. Adequate safety margins are preserved even during transient events caused by wind disturbances and rapid accelerations.

This confirms that commercially available high-load linear actuators can meet the operational requirements of the optimized design without excessive oversizing.

7.4.2 Structural Integrity and Reliability

The optimized Stewart platform maintains acceptable stress levels, deflections, and stiffness under dynamic loading. No instability, resonance, or excessive vibration is observed during simulation.

These results indicate that the structure is mechanically robust and suitable for long-term operation with large and massive antenna payloads.

7.4.3 Control and Implementation Considerations

The smooth actuator force profiles and well-damped system response suggest that standard control strategies—such as force or position control with feedback—can be effectively implemented. The absence of singularity proximity during dynamic motion further simplifies control design and enhances reliability.

7.4.4 Environmental and Operational Robustness

The system exhibits strong robustness against external disturbances, particularly wind-induced loads. This is critical for large antennas exposed to open environments, where unpredictable external forces are common.

The optimized design ensures stable operation across the full usable workspace under realistic environmental conditions.

7.4.5 Integration with Antenna and Support Structures

8. Conclusions and Future Work

8.1 Conclusions

* Summary of findings
This paper investigated the structural parameter optimization of a 6-DOF Stewart platform for driving a large and massive 12 m satellite antenna. An integrated design and optimization framework combining kinematic, static, and dynamic analyses was developed to address the stringent performance requirements of large-aperture antenna systems.

The main conclusions can be summarized as follows:

1. Effectiveness of Parallel Actuation
   The Stewart platform architecture provides high load capacity, structural stiffness, and positioning accuracy, making it well suited for large antenna actuation compared with conventional serial drive systems.

2. Importance of Structural Parameter Optimization
   The geometric parameters of the platform—including base radius, platform radius, limb length, and joint layout—have a strong and coupled influence on workspace, stiffness, and actuator force distribution. Integrated optimization is therefore essential.

3. Multi-objective Optimization Performance
   The proposed multi-objective optimization framework successfully balanced competing objectives, achieving increased usable workspace, reduced actuator forces, and improved stiffness while respecting geometric, actuator, and safety constraints.

4. Static and Dynamic Validation

5. Practical Feasibility for Large Antenna Systems
   The optimized design satisfies real-world implementation requirements, including actuator capacity, control feasibility, and environmental robustness, confirming its applicability to large-aperture antenna systems.

Overall, the results demonstrate that optimization-driven design of Stewart platforms is a viable and effective solution for high-precision actuation of large and massive satellite antennas.

Why this conclusion works

✔ Clearly summarizes contributions
✔ Links theory → optimization → validation → feasibility
✔ Strong but not overstated
✔ Ready for journal submission

* Effectiveness of optimized design
The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimized Stewart platform design for large-aperture antenna actuation. By jointly optimizing key structural parameters, the proposed design achieves a favorable balance between stiffness, actuator force requirements, and usable workspace. Compared with the initial configuration, the optimized structure exhibits significantly reduced peak actuator loads, improved force distribution, and enhanced rigidity across the operational workspace. Both static and dynamic analyses confirm that the optimized design maintains stable and accurate performance under nominal tracking motion as well as extreme load conditions. These improvements validate that the proposed optimization framework leads to a mechanically efficient, dynamically robust, and practically implementable solution for driving large and massive antenna systems.

8.2 Limitations

* Modeling assumptions
Although the proposed optimization framework and validation results demonstrate strong performance, several modeling assumptions were adopted to maintain analytical tractability and computational efficiency. These assumptions introduce limitations that should be acknowledged.

First, the antenna structure and the Stewart platform components were modeled as rigid bodies. Structural flexibility of the antenna reflector, supporting truss, and robot limbs was neglected. While this assumption is reasonable for low-speed antenna positioning, it may underestimate dynamic deflections and vibration effects in high-wind or high-acceleration scenarios.

Second, joint friction, backlash, and actuator nonlinearities were not explicitly modeled. In practical systems, these factors can influence positioning accuracy, control effort, and long-term wear. Their exclusion may lead to optimistic estimates of tracking performance and actuator smoothness.

Third, environmental effects were simplified. Wind loads were modeled as steady or quasi-static disturbances, and thermal effects were not considered. In real-world outdoor installations, time-varying wind turbulence and thermal deformation may affect structural behavior and pointing accuracy.

Finally, control dynamics were simplified by assuming ideal force or position tracking at the actuator level. Detailed controller design, sensor noise, and time delays were not included in the simulation.

Despite these limitations, the adopted assumptions are consistent with early-stage design and optimization studies and provide valuable insight into the fundamental structural and dynamic behavior of the system.

Why this subsection strengthens your paper

✔ Shows scientific honesty
✔ Clearly bounds validity of results
✔ Anticipates reviewer concerns
✔ Naturally motivates future work

* Simplifications
To enable systematic optimization and efficient simulation, several simplifications were introduced in this study, which may affect the fidelity of the results.

The mechanical structure of the Stewart platform was simplified by assuming ideal spherical and universal joints with unlimited rotational freedom. In practical implementations, joint size, clearances, and mechanical constraints may slightly reduce the usable workspace and affect force transmission characteristics.

The optimization process considered a reduced set of structural parameters, focusing primarily on geometric variables such as platform radii, limb lengths, and joint layout angles. Material selection, cross-sectional dimensions of the limbs, and joint stiffness were not included as optimization variables, although they can significantly influence stiffness and mass distribution.

Furthermore, dynamic simulations were conducted under prescribed motion profiles rather than closed-loop control. This open-loop approach simplifies analysis but does not capture the full interaction between control dynamics and mechanical behavior.

These simplifications are acceptable for conceptual design and comparative evaluation; however, they indicate that further refinement is required before final engineering implementation.

Why this works well

✔ Clearly distinguishes simplifications from assumptions
✔ Shows awareness of practical design factors
✔ Keeps limitations reasonable, not critical
✔ Sets up future extensions naturally

8.3 Future Work

* Experimental validation
Future work will focus on experimental validation of the proposed optimized Stewart platform to further confirm its performance under real-world operating conditions. A scaled or full-scale prototype will be developed to evaluate the practical feasibility of the optimized structural parameters.

Experimental studies will include static load testing to verify actuator force distribution and structural stiffness, as well as dynamic tests to assess tracking accuracy, vibration behavior, and disturbance rejection. Environmental effects such as wind excitation and temperature variation will also be considered where feasible.

In addition, closed-loop control strategies will be implemented and tested to evaluate controller–structure interaction, actuator nonlinearities, and sensor noise effects. The experimental results will be used to refine the modeling assumptions and improve the accuracy of the optimization framework.

Overall, experimental validation will provide essential insight into the real-world performance of parallel robot–based actuation systems for large-aperture antennas and support their transition from conceptual design to practical deployment.

Why this future work section is effective

✔ Directly addresses current limitations
✔ Proposes realistic next steps
✔ Appeals to both reviewers and practitioners
✔ Keeps scope ambitious but feasible

* Control strategy integration
An important direction for future research is the integration of advanced control strategies with the optimized Stewart platform design. While this study focused on structural optimization and open-loop dynamic validation, closed-loop control is essential for achieving high-precision antenna pointing under disturbances and modeling uncertainties.

Future work will investigate position–force hybrid control, robust control, and model-based nonlinear control strategies tailored to parallel mechanisms driving large and heavy payloads. Special attention will be given to mitigating the effects of actuator saturation, joint compliance, and external disturbances such as wind loads.

In addition, the optimized structural parameters will be co-designed with control laws to further improve tracking accuracy, stability margins, and disturbance rejection. This control–structure co-optimization approach is expected to enhance overall system performance and reliability.

The integration of control strategies will move the proposed system closer to real-world deployment and enable high-precision, autonomous operation of large-aperture antenna systems.

Why this section works well

✔ Extends beyond mechanics into system-level design
✔ Clearly motivated by limitations
✔ Modern and forward-looking
✔ Reviewer-friendly scope

* Thermal and environmental effects
Future research will also consider the influence of thermal and environmental effects on the performance of the optimized Stewart platform driving large-aperture antennas. In real operating environments, temperature gradients, solar radiation, and ambient weather conditions can induce thermal deformation in both the antenna structure and the parallel robot, potentially degrading pointing accuracy and stiffness.

Thermal expansion of structural members, joints, and actuators will be incorporated into the kinematic and static models to assess their impact on geometric accuracy and force distribution. Additionally, time-varying environmental loads such as turbulent wind and temperature fluctuations will be modeled to evaluate long-term stability and fatigue behavior.

Coupled thermo-mechanical simulations and, where possible, experimental measurements will be employed to validate the extended models. Incorporating thermal and environmental effects will further improve the reliability and robustness of the proposed actuation system, particularly for outdoor or space-related antenna applications.
